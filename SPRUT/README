  This directory constains SPRUT is a translator of a compiler
internal representation description (IRD) into Standard Procedural
Interface (SPI).  The most convenient form of the internal
representation is a directed graph.  IRD defines structure of the
graph.  SPI provides general graph manipulating functions.  The
defined graph nodes can be decorated with attributes of arbitrary
types.

  IRD declares types of nodes of the graph.  Nodes contains fields,
part of them represents links between nodes, and another part of them
stores attributes of arbitrary types.  To make easy describing
internal representation the IRD supports explicitly multiple
inheritance in node types.  There can be several levels of internal
representation description in separate files.  The nodes of one level
refer to the nodes of previous levels.  Therefore each next level
enriches source program internal representation.  For example, the
zero level representation may be internal representation for scanner,
the first level may be internal representation for parser, and so on.

  SPI can contains functions to construct and destroy graphs and graph
nodes, to copy graphs or graph nodes, to read and write graphs or
graph nodes from (to) files, to print graphs or graph nodes, to check
up constraints on graph, to traverse graphs, and to transform acyclic
graphs in some commonly used manners.  SPI can also check up the most
important constraints on internal representation during work with node
fields.  SPI can automatically maintain back links between internal
representation nodes.
