<P>An internal representation description is translated by SPRUT
(internal representation definition translator) into a standard
procedural interface (SPI).  If the specification file is an extension
(see the language description) of another specification file the later
is also used to SPI generation and so on.  SPI consists of interface
and implementation files having the same names as one of the
specification file and correspondingly suffixes `.h' and `.c' (C code)
or `.cpp' (C++ code).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="sprut.html#toc3.1">C SPI</A>
</H2>

<P>By default (when option `-c++' is not present on the command line)
SPRUT generates C SPI.  The following subsections describe C SPI.</P>

<H3>C SPI types, variables, macros</H3>

<P>Interface file of SPI consists of C declarations of the following
types, variables and macros.
<OL>
<LI>Type `IR_node_mode_t' is represented by enumeration
definition.  There is enumeration constant with node type name
and prefix `IR_NM_' for each node type declaration even for
abstract node type.  Also there are enumeration constants with
names `IR_NM__root' and `IR_NM__error' for and predefined type
`%root' and for error nodes.  `IR_NM' is abbreviation of
internal representation node mode.  There is also the
enumeration name `IR_node_mode_enum' which is convenient to
use in imported section for forward definition of pointer to
this enumeration.
</LI>
<LI>Type `IR_node_t' represents a node (more correctly pointer to
a structure representing node).  There are the type value
`NULL' reserved to represent none node.
<P>The structure of this type is opaque and all work with nodes
are to be fulfilled through macros (or/and functions).  But to
show efficacy of types implementation it should be said that
every node type is turned into a structure declaration.  All
these structures have first member of type `IR_node_mode_t'.
Other members represent the node fields except for class
field.  Depending on SPRUT command line option
`-flat-structure' (see SPRUT usage) this structure can contain
also members corresponding to fields declared in super types
of given node type or member which type is structure
corresponding to immediate super type of given node type.
Class fields for each non-abstract node type are represented
by only one separate structure.</P>
<P>The fields in different node types with the same name (when it
is consequence of existing common super type with this field)
have the same displacement from the structure begin because
types of previous fields is guaranteed to be the same in these
structures.  The fields in different node types with the same
name (when it is not consequence of existing common super type
with this field) may have the different displacement from the
structure begin therefore access to such fields requires
additional indirect addressing.</P>
<P>Double linked field (see internal representation description
language) requires more memory (about in five times) for its
implementation.  Speed of SPI work with double linked fields
is sightly slower.  Because additional work is needed only to
setting up the field value and my experience shows that
usually number of setting up fields value is less than number
of their fetching about in ten times.</P>
<P>Type `IR_node_t' is simply pointer to struct representing node
type `%root'.  The name of this structure is `IR_node'.
This name can be used in imported section for forward
reference for nodes (instead of `IR_node_t').</P>

</LI>
<LI>Optional variable `IR_node_name' is array mapping values of type
`IR_node_mode_t' to names (strings) in C. (see also
option -no-node-name in SPRUT usage).
        </LI>
<LI>Variable `IR_node_size' is array mapping values of type
`IR_node_mode_t' to size of corresponding structures on C.
</LI>
<LI>Macro `IR_IS_TYPE(type, supertype)' is evaluated as nonzero if
the first argument of type `IR_node_mode_t' is equal to the
second argument or node type represented by the first argument
is a sub-type of node type represented by the second argument.
Otherwise the macro returns zero.  But this macro returns
always zero for any error node, i.e.  this macro can be used
to define that the node of the first mode has fields of the
node of the second mode.
        </LI>
<LI>Macro `IR_NODE_MODE(node)' returns node mode represented by
value of type `IR_node_mode_t' for node given as the macro
argument of type `IR_node_t'.
</LI>
<LI>Macro `IR_IS_OF_TYPE(node, supertype)' is abbreviation of
frequently used `IR_IS_TYPE (IR_NODE_MODE (node), supertype)'.
</LI>
<LI>Macro `IR_NODE_LEVEL(node)' has value which is internal
representation description level in which declaration of given
node type starts.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<H3>C Functions</H3>

<P>SPI interface file also contains definitions of generated functions to
creation, deletion, modification, comparison, copy, check, print, and
binary input/output of internal representation nodes and functions for
access to values of internal representation node fields.</P>
<P>These functions do not permit to work with abstract nodes.  Only one
graph function can be active, e.g.  call of function `IR_check_graph'
is not permitted during work of any traverse or transformation
function.</P>
<P>Macros can be generated with or instead of the functions for access to
internal representation node fields.  This feature should be used if
used C preprocessor has not rigid constraints on number of defined
macros.  Because macros arguments may be evaluated many times no
side-effects should be in the arguments.
<OL>
<LI>Access functions (or/and macros).  These functions are
generated when option `-access' is present in the SPRUT command
line.  If option `-macro' is used the access functions and
macros are generated.  If option `-only-macro' is used only
access macros are generated.  Only option `-macro' or
`-only-macro' can be on the command line of SPRUT.  There is
one function for each field with unique name.  Access function
has name formed from prefix `IR_' and corresponding field
name.  There is one exception.  When access functions and
macros are generated, macros have names starting with prefix
`IR_' and the functions have names starting with prefix
`IR_F_'.  Access function has one argument of type `IR_node_t'.
The argument represents node which must have such field.  Type
of returned value is predefined type (if the field is of such
type) or `IR_node_t' (if the field is of a node type).

</LI>
<LI>Modification functions.  These functions are generated when
option `-set' is present in the SPRUT command line.  There is
one functions for each field with unique name.  Modification
function has name formed from prefix `IR_set_' and
corresponding field name.
<P>Modification function has two arguments. The first argument of
type `IR_node_t' represents node which must have such field.
The second argument of predefined type (if the field is of
such type) or of type `IR_node_t' (if the field is of a node
type) represents new value of the field.</P>
<P>The function may check up constraint if the field represents
arc to node of a node type or its sub-types (see SPRUT

is generated in any case.  This function allocates storage for
node of any type (except for abstract) represented by the
argument (it can be also `IRNM__error), sets up node mode and
node level, fulfills fields assignments (except for class
fields) in the same order as the fields are declared.  The
field assignment is fulfilled according to type specific
operation (see section `Type specific macros') and actions
which are defined after given field in sections of skeleton
and other fields of corresponding node type.  After that the
function returns the created node.  The single way to create
error nodes is to use this function with argument
`IRNM__error'.
</LI>
<LI>Node type specific creation functions.  These functions are
generated when option `-new' is present in the SPRUT command
line.  There is one function for each node type (except for
abstract).  Names of functions are formed from prefix
`IR_new_' and corresponding node type name.  The number of
parameters of a function is equal to one of skeleton fields of
corresponding node type.  The parameters of these functions
have to be given in the order of the skeleton fields in the
specification.  Fields of the super-type (recursively) precede
the ones of the sub-type.
<P>These functions may check up constraints on skeleton fields
which represent arc to node of a node type or its sub-types
(see SPRUT options).  These functions call node creation
function and after that assign parameters values to
corresponding skeleton fields.  After that the functions
return the created node.  These functions provide a mechanism
similar to record aggregates.  Nested calls of such functions
allow programming with terms as in LISP.</P>

This function is generated when option `-check' or

code (see the internal representation definition language).
The user is responsible to adhere to the constraints.
Function `IR_check_node' can be used to check all constraints
corresponding to given node.  The function does nothing if the

<P>SPRUT generates C++ SPI only when option `-c++' is present on the
command line.  Mainly C++ SPI is analogous to one on C.  Major
difference is that `IR_node_t' and `IR_double_link_t' are pointer to
classes not to structures.  As the consequence, the most of functions
are public or friend functions of the classes.</P>

<H3>C++ SPI types, variables, macros</H3>

<P>C++ interface file of SPI consists of C++ declarations of the following
types, variables.
<OL>
<LI>Type `IR_node_mode_t' is represented by enumeration
definition.  There is enumeration constant with node type name
and prefix `IR_NM_' for each node type declaration even for
abstract node type.  Also there are enumeration constants with
names `IR_NM__root' and `IR_NM__error' for and predefined type
`%root' and for error nodes.  `IR_NM' is abbreviation of
internal representation node mode.  There is also the
enumeration name `IR_node_mode_enum' which is convenient to
use in imported section for forward definition of pointer to
this enumeration.
</LI>
<LI>Type `IR_node_t' represents a node (more correctly pointer to
a class representing node).  There are the type value
`NULL' reserved to represent none node.
<P>The class of this type is opaque (i.e. there are not public
variables in the class) and all work with nodes are to be
fulfilled through public or friend functions.  But to show
efficacy of types implementation it should be said that every
node type is turned into a structure declaration.  All these
structures have first member of type `IR_node_mode_t'.  Other
members represent the node fields except for SPRUT class
field.  Depending on SPRUT command line option
`-flat-structure' (see SPRUT usage) this structure can contain
also members corresponding to fields declared in super types
of given node type or member which type is structure
corresponding to immediate super type of given node type.
SPRUT class fields for each non-abstract node type are
represented by only one separate structure.</P>
<P>The fields in different node types with the same name (when it
is consequence of existing common super type with this field)
have the same displacement from the structure begin because

<OL>
<LI>Initialization and finalization macros.  These macros can
assign an initial value to field or/and even construct complex

Finalization is performed immediately before the node is

macros have names formed from prefixes correspondingly
`IR_BEGIN_' and `IR_END_' and name of the field type, e.g.

`IR_BEGIN_integer'

By default initialization macros have definition
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

initiates a pointer by NULL value.

<LI>Copy macros.  The operation copy is used by copy functions
generated by SPRUT.  These macros have names formed from prefix

fields of a pointer type.  The user has to take care about the
macros redefinition if value semantics is needed.
</LI>
<LI>Equality macros.  These macros check whether two fields are
equal.  They are used in functions which test the equality of
nodes.  These macros have names formed from prefix `IR_EQUAL_'
