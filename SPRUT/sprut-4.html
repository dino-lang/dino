NAME
       sprut - internal representation description translator

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       SPRUT (internal representation definition translator) gen-
       erates standard procedural interface ( SPI ) for work with
       internal representation which is described  in  specifica-
       tion  file.   The  specification  file  must  have  suffix
       `.sprut' file is an extension (see  language  description)
       of  another  specification  file the later is also used to
       SPI generation and so on.

       SPI consists of interface and implementation files  having
       the  same  names  as  one of specification file and corre-
       spondingly suffixes `.h' and `.c' (C code) or `.cpp'  (C++
       code).

       Full  documentation  of  SPRUT and SPI see in SPRUT User's
       manual.

OPTIONS
       The options which are known for SPRUT are:

       -c++   Output of C++ code instead  of  C  code  (which  is
              default).

       -v     SPRUT  outputs  verbose  warning information (about
              fields with the same name in different node  types,
              about repeated declaration of a predefined type and
              so on) to standard error stream.

       -statistics
              SPRUT outputs statistic information  (about  number
              of  (all,  abstract,  double) node types, number of
              (all, double,  synonym,  class,  skeleton,  others)
              fields) to standard output stream.

       -flat  SPRUT  generates  code  for  flat  work  with  node
              fields.  It means that node fields declared  in  an
              abstract  type  are  processed  in each place where
              fields of corresponding sub-type are processed.  By
              default  SPRUT  generates code which processes node
              fields recursively (i.e.  code for processing (e.g.
              copying)  fields  declared in super types exists in
              one exemplar.  The option usage generates more fast
              code, but the code is considerably bigger.

       -flat-structure
              SPRUT generates flat implementation of C/C++ struc-
              tures corresponding to node types, i.e.  node  type
              is  represented  by  C/C++ structure which contains
              members corresponding to all node fields  including
              fields  declared in super types of given node type.
              By default SPRUT  generates  the  structures  which
              contain   only   members  corresponding  to  fields
              declared only in given node type and  member  whose
              type  is structure corresponding to immediate super
              type  of  given  node  type.    This   considerably
              decreases  number  C/C++  declarations in interface
              file especially with many node  types  with  multi-
              level inheritance.

       -fast  This  option  forces  to  generate  some  tables as
              unpacked and as a consequence to speed up code  for
              access to fields.  By default the tables are gener-
              ated as packed.  This results in considerable  mem-
              ory economy.

       -long-node-size
              IRTD  generates many long tables which contain dis-
              placements relative to begin  of  C/C++  structures
              which  implement  node  types.   This  option usage
              forces to represent the displacements  as  unsigned
              long.  As a consequence any size nodes can be used.
              By default it is believed that  size  of  structure
              implementing  a  node  is represented by byte, i.e.
              maximal size of C/C++  structures  which  implement
              nodes  is supposed to be not greater than 255 bytes
              and as a consequence much memory is economized.  It
              should  be  remember  that function `IR_start' (see
              SPI) generated in debugging mode checks correctness
              of real node sizes.

       -short-node-size
              This option usage forces to represent the displace-
              ments in  structures  implementing  node  types  as
              unsigned short.  See also option `-long-node-size'.

       -macro SPRUT generates access macros  and  functions  (see
              SPI).   Only option `-macro' or `only-macro' can be
              in SPRUT command line.

       -only-macro
              SPRUT generates macros instead of access  functions
              (see SPI).

       -debug SPRUT  generates  checking constraint determined by
              type sub-type relations in node  field  declaration
              in  modification  functions  (see SPI).  Also other
              checks (e.g.  that a node has given field and  oth-
              ers)  are  fulfilled  by  SPI  functions  (but  not

              macros) generated under this option.

       -pprefix
              Generated SPI uses `prefix' instead  of  `IR_'  for
              names of SPI objects.

       -no-line
              SPRUT  does  not generate files containing numbered
              line directives.

       -all   SPRUT generates all SPI functions.  Its  effect  is
              equivalent to presence of all subsequent options in
              the command line.

       -access
              SPRUT generates access functions (see SPI).

       -set   SPRUT generates modification functions (see SPI).

       -new   SPRUT generates node type specific  creation  func-
              tions (see SPI).

       -free  SPRUT generates function for deletion of nodes (see
              SPI).

       -free-graph
              SPRUT generates functions for  deletion  of  graphs
              and nodes (see SPI).

       -copy  SPRUT  generates  function  for  copying nodes (see
              SPI).

       -copy-graph
              SPRUT generates functions for  copying  graphs  and
              nodes (see SPI).

       -equal SPRUT generates function for determination of nodes
              equality (see SPI).

       -equal-graph
              SPRUT  generates  functions  for  determination  of
              nodes and graphs equality (see SPI).

       -check SPRUT  generates  function  for  checking node con-
              straints (see SPI).

       -check-graph
              SPRUT generates functions for  checking  nodes  and
              graphs constraints (see SPI).

       -print SPRUT  generates  function  for printing nodes (see
              SPI).

       -input SPRUT generates function for input  of  nodes  (see

              SPI).

       -output
              SPRUT  generates  function for output of nodes (see
              SPI).

       -traverse
              SPRUT generates function for traversing graphs (see
              SPI).

       -reverse-traverse
              SPRUT  generates  function  for  reverse traversing
              graphs (see SPI).

       -transform
              SPRUT generates functions for transforming  acyclic
              graphs (see SPI).

       -no-node-name
              SPRUT does not generate array containing node names
              (see SPI) if it is not necessary.  For example, the
              array is necessary when function for print of nodes
              are generated.
