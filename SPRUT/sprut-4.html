DESCRIPTION
       SPRUT (internal representation definition translator)  generates  stan‐
       dard procedural interface ( SPI ) for work with internal representation
       which is described in specification file.  The specification file  must
       have suffix `.sprut'.
         If  the specification file is an extension (see language description)
       of another specification file the later is also used to SPI  generation
       and so on.

       SPI  consists  of  interface  and  implementation files having the same
       names as one of specification file and  correspondingly  suffixes  `.h'
       and `.c' (C code) or `.cpp' (C++ code).

       Full documentation of SPRUT and SPI see in SPRUT User's manual.

OPTIONS
       The options which are known for SPRUT are:

       -c++   Output of C++ code instead of C code (which is default).

       -v     SPRUT outputs verbose warning information (about fields with the
              same name in different node types, about repeated declaration of
              a predefined type and so on) to standard error stream.

       -statistics
              SPRUT  outputs  statistic  information  (about  number  of (all,
              abstract, double) node types, number of (all,  double,  synonym,
              class, skeleton, others) fields) to standard output stream.

       -flat  SPRUT  generates  code for flat work with node fields.  It means
              that node fields declared in an abstract type are  processed  in
              each place where fields of corresponding sub-type are processed.
              By default SPRUT generates  code  which  processes  node  fields
              recursively  (i.e.   code  for processing (e.g.  copying) fields
              declared in super types exists  in  one  exemplar.   The  option
              usage  generates  more  fast  code, but the code is considerably
              bigger.

       -flat-structure
              SPRUT generates flat implementation of C/C++  structures  corre‐
              sponding  to node types, i.e.  node type is represented by C/C++
              structure which  contains  members  corresponding  to  all  node
              fields  including  fields  declared in super types of given node
              type.  By default SPRUT generates the structures  which  contain
              only members corresponding to fields declared only in given node
              type and member whose type is structure corresponding to immedi‐
              ate  super type of given node type.  This considerably decreases
              number C/C++ declarations in interface file especially with many
              node types with multi-level inheritance.

       -fast  This  option forces to generate some tables as unpacked and as a
              consequence to speed up code for access to fields.   By  default
              the  tables  are generated as packed.  This results in consider‐
              able memory economy.

       -long-node-size
              IRTD generates many long tables which contain displacements rel‐
              ative  to  begin of C/C++ structures which implement node types.
              This option usage  forces  to  represent  the  displacements  as
              unsigned long.  As a consequence any size nodes can be used.  By
              default it is believed that size  of  structure  implementing  a
              node  is represented by byte, i.e.  maximal size of C/C++ struc‐
              tures which implement nodes is supposed to be not  greater  than
              255  bytes  and  as a consequence much memory is economized.  It
              should be remember that function `IR_start' (see SPI)  generated
              in debugging mode checks correctness of real node sizes.

       -short-node-size
              This  option  usage  forces  to  represent  the displacements in
              structures implementing node types as unsigned short.  See  also
              option `-long-node-size'.

       -macro SPRUT  generates  access  macros  and functions (see SPI).  Only
              option `-macro' or `only-macro' can be in SPRUT command line.

       -only-macro
              SPRUT generates macros instead of access functions (see SPI).

       -debug SPRUT generates checking constraint determined by type  sub-type
              relations  in  node  field declaration in modification functions
              (see SPI).  Also other checks (e.g.  that a node has given field
              and others) are fulfilled by SPI functions (but not macros) gen‐
              erated under this option.

       -pprefix
              Generated SPI uses `prefix' instead of `IR_' for  names  of  SPI
              objects.

       -no-line
              SPRUT  does  not  generate files containing numbered line direc‐
              tives.

       -all   SPRUT generates all SPI functions.  Its effect is equivalent  to
              presence of all subsequent options in the command line.

       -access
              SPRUT generates access functions (see SPI).

       -set   SPRUT generates modification functions (see SPI).

       -new   SPRUT generates node type specific creation functions (see SPI).

       -free  SPRUT generates function for deletion of nodes (see SPI).

       -free-graph
              SPRUT  generates functions for deletion of graphs and nodes (see
              SPI).

       -copy  SPRUT generates function for copying nodes (see SPI).

       -copy-graph
              SPRUT generates functions for  copying  graphs  and  nodes  (see
              SPI).

       -equal SPRUT  generates  function  for  determination of nodes equality
              (see SPI).

       -equal-graph
              SPRUT generates functions for determination of nodes and  graphs
              equality (see SPI).

       -check SPRUT  generates  function  for  checking  node constraints (see
              SPI).

       -check-graph
              SPRUT generates functions for checking  nodes  and  graphs  con‐
              straints (see SPI).

       -print SPRUT generates function for printing nodes (see SPI).

       -input SPRUT generates function for input of nodes (see SPI).

       -output
              SPRUT generates function for output of nodes (see SPI).

       -traverse
              SPRUT generates function for traversing graphs (see SPI).

       -reverse-traverse
              SPRUT  generates  function  for  reverse  traversing graphs (see
              SPI).

       -transform
              SPRUT generates functions for transforming acyclic  graphs  (see
              SPI).

       -no-node-name
              SPRUT does not generate array containing node names (see SPI) if
              it is not necessary.  For example, the array is  necessary  when
              function for print of nodes are generated.
