  This directory contains SHILKA is oriented to fast recognition of
keywords and standard identifiers in compilers.  SHILKA is analogous
to GNU package `gperf' but based on minimal pruned O-trie which can
take into accout the frequency of keyword occurences in the program.
Gperf can not make it.  SHILKA is up to 20% faster than Gperf.  SHILKA
is also simpler than Gperf in the usage.

  To install SHILKA see file INSTALL in the current directory.

  Documentation of SHILKA is in files `shilka.1', `shilka.txt',
`shilka.dvi', `shilka.ps', `shilka.info*', `shilka*.html',
`shilka*.rtf'.
