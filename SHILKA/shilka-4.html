NAME
       shilka - keywords description translator

SYNOPSIS
       shilka [ -c++ --statistics -inline -strip -length -case -no-definitions
       -interface -export -enum -pprefix -time -fast n -w -h -help -v]  speci‐
       fication-file

DESCRIPTION
       SHILKA  generates code for fast recognition of pipeline hazards of pro‐
       cessor which is described in  specification  file.   The  specification
       file must have suffix `.shilka'

       The  generated  code  consists of optional interface and implementation
       files having the same names as one of  specification  file  and  corre‐
       spondingly  suffixes  `.h'  (if option -interface is given) and `.c' (C
       code) or `.cpp' (C++ code).

       The fast recognition of keywords is based on structure called as  mini‐
       mal  prunned  O-trie.  Full documentation of SHILKA is in SHILKA User's
       manual.

OPTIONS
       The options which are known for SHILKA are:

       -c++   Output of C++ code instead of C code (which is default).

       -statistics
              Generation of macro definition which switches on  gathering  and
              printing  keyword  occurrence  statistics.  Then such statistics
              can be used for setting up frequencies in the  description  file
              for faster recognition of keywords.

       -inline
              Generation  of  function  of keyword recognition as inline (take
              care with used C compiler).  This can be speed up keyword recog‐
              nition.

       -strip Striping  off  code  for  gathering and printing statistics.  By
              default the code is present in  the  implementation  file.   The
              code  can  be  switched  on by definition of a macro (see option
              -statistics ).

       -length
              Usage of strncmp instead of strcmp to  compare  keywords.   This
              can  be  useful  if keyword is represented by a string without C
              string end marker (' ').

       -case  Keywords case is ignored during their recognition.  This is use‐
              ful  for  recognition keywords (or standard identifiers) in such
              language as Fortran.

       -no-definitions
              No generation of macros (or enumeration) defining identifiers of
              keywords.

       -interface
              Generation of additional interface file (with suffix `.h' ).

       -export
              SHILKA  generates macros defining identifiers of keywords in the
              interface file (instead of in the  implementation  file).   This
              option has sense only when -interface is present.

       -enum  Output  of  enumeration instead of macro definitions for identi‐
              fiers of keywords.

       -pprefix
              Usage of prefix instead of `KR_' (default) for names  of  gener‐
              ated objects.

       -time  Output of time statistics of the SHILKA run into stderr.

       -fast n
              If  number  of  rested  unchecked characters is less or equal n,
              then functions  `strcmp'  or  `strncmp'  is  not  used  at  all.
              Instead of this, simply comparing rested unchecked characters is
              used.  This can speed up keyword recognition.  The default value
              of the parameter is 3.

       -w     Disable generation of all warnings.

       -h, -help
              Output of brief help message about SHILKA usage.

       -v     Creation  of  description  file  containing details how the code
              generated by SHILKA will recognize the keywords.

FILES
       file.shilka
              SHILKA specification file
       file.c
              generated C implementation file
       file.cpp
              generated C++ implementation file
       file.h
              generated interface file

       There are no any temporary files used by SHILKA.

ENVIRONMENT
       There are no environment variables which affect SHILKA behavior.

DIAGNOSTICS
       SHILKA diagnostics is self-explanatory.
