   error and reads tokens and discards them until it finds a token

   ahead tokens after token `error' in states which have the `error'
   token is acceptable and which are lower in the parser stack than
   the first state with acceptable token `error'.  In this case the
   feedback from the parser to the scanner could not work correctly

   reads the tokens once.

   Flag (`-minimal-error-recovery') means usage of the minimal cost
   error recovery where the cost is overall number of tokens ignored.
   The feedback from the parser to the scanner does not work
   correctly.  So you shouldn't use this method when there is the
   feedback.  Calling yyerrok has no sense for such method because the
   parser in such recovery mode never executes the rule actions.
