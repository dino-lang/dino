DESCRIPTION
       MSTA reads input grammar which is described in specification  file  and
       generates  parser  for it.  MSTA can process any POSIX YACC grammar and
       generates equivalent parser in the sence of POSIX standard.   But  MSTA
       can  do  many additional things: generation of more safe error recovery
       or much better  error  recovery,  better  output  of  generated  parser
       description,  generation of fast LALR(k)- and LR(k)-grammar parser with
       acceptable space requirements, generation of scanners described as con‐
       text-free  grammar  (CFG), and so on.  The specification file must have
       suffix `.y'

       The generated code consists of optional  interface  and  implementation
       files  and  optional  description  file having the same names as one of
       specification file and correspondingly suffixes `.h' (if option  -d  or
       -c++  is  given)  and  `.c' (C code) or `.cpp' (C++ code) and `.output'
       (description file).  If MSTA runs in  YACC  regime,  the  corresponding
       files  will  be `y.tab.h' (if option -d or -c++ is given) and `y.tab.c'
       (C code) or `y.tab.cpp' (C++ code) and `y.output' (description file).

       Full documentation of MSTA is in MSTA User's manual.

OPTIONS
       The options which are known for MSTA and YACC are:

       -d     Create the interface file.  By default the interface file is not
              generated.

       -l     Insert  user's  original  code  into  generated  parser  without
              `#line' constructs.  By default constructions `#line' are always
              generated.

       -t     Permit  compilation  of debugging code in the code file (tracing
              of the parser work).  Runtime debugging  statements  are  always
              contained  in the parser, but by default conditional compilation
              directives prevent their compilation.  This option defines macro
              `YYDEBUG'  as  1  (by default its value is 0) and as consequence
              the debugging statements are processed.

       -v     Create a file containing description of the parser.

       -b file_prefix
              Use file_prefix instead of `y' as  the  prefix  for  all  output
              filenames when YACC regime of generated file names is on.

       -p sym_prefix
              Use  sym_prefix  instead  of  yy  as the prefix for all external
              names (i.e.  functions yyparse , yylex , and yyerror ,  and  the
              variables yylval , yychar , and yydebug ) produced by MSTA.

       Additional options which are known only for MSTA are:

       -define
              This is synonym of option `-d'

       -line  This is synonym of option `-l'

       -trace This is synonym of option `-t'

       -verbose
              This is synonym of option `-v'

       -h, -help, --help
              These  options  result in that only brief description of options
              is output into stderr.  The same result can be achieved by call‐
              ing MSTA without any options and arguments.

       -w     No any warning messages are generated, e.g. repeated description
              of type, value, and priority of token or terminal, repeated con‐
              struction `%start' and many others.

       -c++   Output of C++ code instead of C code (which is default).

       -enum  Generate token constants as enumeration instead of macro.

       -no-enum
              Generate token constants as macro (this is default).

       -pattern-equiv
              Equivalent  patterns  are  denoted  by  the same nonterminal (by
              default).  Sometimes this results in dramatic reducing conflicts
              when complex patterns are used.

       -no-pattern-equiv
              Even  equivalent  patterns are denoted by different nonterminals
              and are expanded into the different set of rules

       -look-ahead number, -la number
              Determine maximal length of look-ahead when  LR(k)  and  LALR(k)
              generated  parser.   This does not mean that MSTA in each situa‐
              tion and for each input will look ahead on given number  tokens.
              MSTA  looks  ahead only on minimal number of tokens required for
              resolution of a conflict.  The default  value  of  maximal  look
              ahead is 1.

       -lr    Input grammar is considered to be a LR(k)-grammar.

       -no-lr Input  grammar  is  considered to be a LALR(k)-grammar.  This is
              default.

       -lalr-optimization
              If the input grammar is considered to be a  LR(k)-grammar,  MSTA
              will  make LALR(k)-optimization after building LR(k)-parser.  It
              means that MSTA will extract LALR(k)-parts of LR(k)-grammar  and
              will  represent  them  by  addequate  LALR-sets.   If  the input
              LR(k)-grammar is "almost" a LALR(k)-grammar, MSTA can  descrease
              size  of  the  generated  parser in several times.  If the input
              grammar is a LALR(k)-grammar, MSTA will  create  LALR(k)-parser.
              This option is default when option `-lr' is given.

       -no-lalr-optimization
              When  option  `-lr'  is given, MSTA does not make LALR-optimiza‐
              tion.

       -regular-optimization
              After building LALR-sets or LR-sets and optional  LALR-optimiza‐
              tion,  MSTA  makes extracting regular parts of input grammar and
              implement them by adequate methods (deterministic finite automa‐
              ton).   This  decreases  number of final states in the generated
              parser, speeds up the parser, but sigthly increases  the  parser
              size  because  some actions will be present in several examplars
              in the parser.  The more regular parts in the input grammar, the
              better this method works.  By default this option is on.

       -no-regular-optimization
              Disable the regular optimizations.

       -split-lr-sets
              Splitting  LR-sets  during  regular  optimization  in  order  to
              extract the most of regular parts (only when  option  `-regular-
              optimization'   is  on).   By  default  this  option  is  on  if
              `%free_format' is present in the specification file.

       -no-split-lr-sets
              Option is opposite to the previous one.  By default this  option
              is on if `%free_format' is absent in the specification file.

       -yacc-error-recovery
              The  generated  parser will use error recover according to Posix
              YACC standard.  This error recovery is used by default.

       -local-error-recovery
              The generated parser will use sligthly modified  error  recovery
              method.   This  method is more safe.  It is guaranteed that this
              method can not be cycled.

       -minimal-error-recovery
              The generated parser will use  a  minimal  cost  error  recovery
              where the cost is overall number of tokens ignored.  It is guar‐
              anteed that this method can  not  be  cycled.   This  method  is
              expensive  because  it may save many input tokens, parser states
              and attributes.

       -error-reduce
              MSTA generates parser with possible  default  reducing  (without
              checking the look ahead) when the token error is in the context.
              It means the parser may make a few reduces before recognizing  a
              syntax error.  This option is default.

       -no-error-reduce
              The option means that the generated parser makes reduces in sit‐
              uation where shift on error is possible only when there is  cor‐
              responding  look ahead.  It results in better error recovery but
              the parser will have bigger size.

       -error-conflict
              MSTA reports conflicts on look ahead containing token  error  in
              LR-set  which  is a result of shifting token error.  This option
              is default.

       -no-error-conflict
              Token error is not a real token it is never read but many  error
              recovery  rules  may generate conflicts on error.  To avoid this
              you can use the option.  In this case MSTA does report conflicts
              on look ahead containing token error in LR-set which is a result
              of shifting token error.

       -yacc-input
              Only Posix YACC input can be used as input grammar.

       -no-yacc-input
              All input grammar features of MSTA can be used.  This option  is
              default.

       -yacc-file-names
              MSTA  output  file names are generated according to Posix YACC (
              y.output , y.tab.c , y.tab.h).

       -strict
              Use only strict POSIX YACC input (this option is in action  only
              when  -yacc-input  )  not  SYSTEM V one.  Errors are output when
              nonstrict features are used.  These features are  usage  of  ';'
              after definitions and C/C++ code insertions and usage of a token
              and a literal in %type clauses as before and after a description
              of the token and the literal.  This option is on by default.

       -no-strict
              This  option  is  in  action  only when -yacc-input is on.  Only
              warnings about non strict POSIX YACC features usage are output.

       -no-yacc-file-names
              Output files will have the same name and suffixes ( .h  ,  .c  ,
              and .output ).  This option is on by default.

       -o     Specify  names  of  output files (header file name.h , code file
              name.c , description file name.output

       -y, -yacc
              Emulate Posix YACC.  It means that the options  `-yacc-input'  ,
              `-lalr'  ,  `-yacc-error-recovery'  , and `-yacc-file-names' are
              on, and -c++ is off.  This option is useful with other  options,
              e.g.  options  `-lr' and `-y' means also `-yacc-input' , `-yacc-
              error-recovery' , and `-yacc-file-names'.

       -full-lr-set
              Write all LR-situations (besides essential ones) of LR-sets into
              a  file  containing  description  of the parser (the option acts
              only with option `-v' ).  Sometimes  it  is  useful  for  better
              understanding  conflicts.  But in this case the description file
              can be significantly bigger.

       -lr-situation-context
              Write context of LR-situations into description  of  the  parser
              (the  option acts only with option `-v' ).  Sometimes it is use‐
              ful for better understanding conflicts.  But in  this  case  the
              description   file   can  be  huge  espicially  for  LR(k)-  and
              LALR(k)-grammar when k > 1 or when  with  option  `-full-lr-set'
              parser generation speed because classic method of LR-, LALR-sets
              is used instead of fast DeRemer method.  By default this  option
              is off.

       -removed-lr-sets
              Write  LR-sets  removed  during  conflict resolution and regular
              optimization into description of the  parser  (the  option  acts
              only  with option -v ).  By default such unchievable LR-sets are
              not present in the description file.

       -expand
              Attributes and states stacks in the parser  will  be  expandable
              (this is default).

       -no-expand
              Attributes  and  states stacks in the parser will be not expand‐
              able.

       -time  Output detail time statistics of MSTA work on its  basic  passes
              and optimizations.

FILES
       file.y
              MSTA specification file
       file.c or y.tab.c
              generated C implementation file
       file.cpp or y.tab.cpp

              generated interface file
       file.output or y.output
              generated interface file
       There are no any temporary files used by MSTA.

ENVIRONMENT
       There are no environment variables which affect MSTA behavior.

DIAGNOSTICS
