  This directory MSTA contains syntax description translator of a
language.  The MSTA can emulate YACC (Posix standard).  The MSTA have
the following additional features:
    
    o Fast LR(k) and LALR(k) grammars (with possibility resolution of
      conflicts).  Look ahead of only necessary depth (not necessary
      given k).  Originally LALR(k) parsers are generated by modified
      fast DeRemer's algorithm.

    o Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), and constructions for more
      convinient description of the scanners. More convinient
      naming attributes.

    o Optimizations (extracting LALR- and regular parts of grammars and
      implementing parsing them by adequate methods) which permit to
      use MSTA for generation of effective lexical analyzers.

    o More safe error recovery and reporting (besides error
      recovery method of YACC).

    o Fast generation of fast parsers.

  To install MSTA see file INSTALL in the current directory.

  Documentation of MSTA is in files `msta.1', `msta.txt', `msta.dvi',
`msta.ps', `msta.info*', `msta*.html'.
