   TITLE:       Instruction scheduler inside basic blocks.

   DESCRIPTION: This file contains invariant part of the scheduler.

   SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:
         Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g. by option `-D' in C compiler
       command line) during the file compilation disables to fix
       some internal errors of the scheduler.
