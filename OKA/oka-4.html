NAME
       oka - pipeline Hazards Description Translator

SYNOPSIS
       oka [ -c++ -debug -enum -export -no-minimization -split number -pprefix
       -v ] specification-file


DESCRIPTION
       OKA generates code for fast recognition of pipeline hazards of  proces‐
       sor  which  is described in specification file.  The specification file
       must have suffix `.oka'


       The generated code consists of interface and implementation files  hav‐
       ing  the  same  names  as one of specification file and correspondingly
       suffixes `.h' and `.c' (C code) or `.cpp' (C++ code).

       Full documentation of OKA is in OKA User's manual.

OPTIONS
       The options which are known for OKA are:

       -c++   OKA generates C++ code instead of C code (default).

       -debug OKA creates code for output of debugging information during exe‐
              cution of the generated code.

       -enum  OKA  generates  instruction  codes  as enumeration constant.  By
              default OKA generates instructions code as macro definition.

       -export
              OKA generates macros defining identifiers of instructions in the
              interface file (instead of in the implementation file).

       -no-minimization
              OKA  does  not  minimization  of  generated deterministic finite
              state automaton (DFA).

       -split OKA makes automatic splitting automaton on given number automata
              in  order  to decrease sizes of generated tables.  The option is
              taken into account only if constructions `%unit' are  absent  in
              the  specification  file.   This option has not been implemented
              yet.

       -pprefix
              Generated code uses `prefix' instead of `OKA' for names  of  the
              generated objects.

       -time  OKA outputs detail time statistics of its work into stderr.

       -v     OKA  creates  description  file  which  contains  description of
              result automaton and statistics information.  The file will have
              the  same  name  as  one  of given specification file and suffix
              `.output' into standard stream.

FILES
       file.oka
              OKA specification file
       file.c
              generated C implementation file
       file.cpp
              generated C++ implementation file
       file.h
              generated interface file

       There are no any temporary files used by OKA.

ENVIRONMENT
       There are no environment variables which affect OKA behavior.

DIAGNOSTICS
       OKA diagnostics is self-explanatory.
