  This directory OKA contains translator of a processor pipeline
hazards description. OKA is a translator of a processor pipeline
hazards description (PHD) into code for fast recognition of pipeline
hazards.  A pipeline hazards description describes mainly reservations
of processor functional units by an instruction during its execution.
The instruction reservations are given by regular expression
describing nondeterministic finite state automaton (NDFA).  All
analogous tools are based only on deterministic finite state automaton
(DFA).

  OKA is accompanied with the scheduler on C and C++ for scheduling
basic blocks (see directory SCHEDULE).

  To install OKA see file INSTALL in the current directory.

  Documentation of OKA is in files `oka.1', `oka.txt', `oka.dvi',
`oka.ps', `oka.info*', `oka*.html', `oka*.rtf'.
