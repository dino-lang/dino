.SH NAME
dino \- the interpreter of the programming language Dino
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dino [ -h -s -t -m size -Idirname -Lpath -O --save-temps -d -p] (-c
.I program
.B |
.I program-file
.B | -i

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dino
interprets a program in the Dino programming language.  The
program file (and include files) must have the suffix
.B .d
.
.PP
The description of Dino language is in the report of the Programming
Language Dino.
.SH OPTIONS
Calling the interpreter without arguments is to call
.I REPL
(an interactive environment for execution of Dino statements and printing the results of
the statement execution).
The options which the Dino interpreter recognizes are:
.IP "-c program"
Execute the Dino
.B program
given on the command line as the argument.
.IP -h
Output information about Dino command line options.
.IP "-m number"
Determine the size of the heap chunks used by the Dino interpreter.
The size can be given in bytes (e.g. 32000), in kilobytes (e.g. 64k),
or in megabytes (e.g. 1m).  The default size is 1 Megabyte.
Initially, the Dino interpreter creates one chunk.  It allocates one
additional chunk (as rule of the same size) whenever there is no
additional memory after garbage collection.
.IP -s
Output some statistics of interpreter work into stderr.  Statistics
contain the maximal heap size, number of heap chunks, and number of
collisions in hash tables which are used for the implementation of
Dino tables.
.IP -t
Output information about call stack of the program into stderr for
unprocessed exception or calling exit function.  This output sometimes
can be different from what people would expect because of tail call
elimination.
.IP -Idirname
Define the directory in which Dino include files will be searched for.
The order of searching in directories given with this option is the same
as the one on the command line.
.IP -Ldirname
Define where to search for external libraries (if shared
libraries are implemented on the system.  This is true for Linux,
Solaris, Irix, OSF, and Windows) in which the Dino external variables and
functions will be searched for.  The order of searching in libraries
given with this option is the same as one on the command line.
.IP -O
Do type inference and byte code specialization.  It can speed up the
program execution, especially when JIT is used.
.IP -d
Output Dino byte code to the standard output.
.IP -i dump-file
Read Dino byte code from a given file and execute it.  You can use this
option instead of providing Dino program file.
.IP --save-temps
If a Dino function processed by JIT compiler, the generated C source code
and PIC object code can be saved after finishing Dino interpreter in directory
.B /tmp
with this option.  The file names will contain identifier number of the
corresponding Dino interpreter process.
.IP -p
Output profile information into stderr.  Profile information contains
the number of calls and execution times of all called functions and
classes.
.SH FILES
.I file.d
.RS
a Dino program file
.RE
.I libdino.so
.RS
a Dino shared library on some Unix systems.
.RE
.I ieee.d
.RS
the Dino file implementing IEEE standard floating point arithmetic.
.RE
.I ieee.so
.RS
the Dino shared library used for implementing IEEE on some Unix systems.
.RE
.I ipcerr.d
.RS
the Dino file definining exceptions of ipc/network software.  This file is
used by socket.d.
.RE
.I ipcerr.so
.RS
the Dino shared library used for implementing IPCERR on some Unix systems.
.RE
.I socket.d
.RS
the Dino file implementing work with sockets.
.RE
.I socket.so
.RS
the Dino shared library used for implementing SOCKET on some Unix systems.
.RE
Dino interpreter creates temporary C and object files for Dino functions
processed by JIT compiler in directory
.B /tmp.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
There are the following environment variables which affect Dino behavior:
.IP DINO_HOME
If not null, it defines the places of the dino shared libraries (such a
library may be only on some Unix systems including Linux and Solaris), include
files, and dino standard external libraries.  The places are defined as
the subdirectory
.B lib
in directory given by the environment variable value.  You should
define the variable value on Windows if you installed the files in
a directory other than
.B "C:\\\\dino\\\\lib"
.IP DINO_PATH
If not null, it defines the places of dino include-files.  The value of
the variable has more priority than
.B DINO_HOME
but less priority than values given through
.B -I
options.
.IP DINO_LIB
If not null, it defines places of dino shared library, if any.  The value of
variable has more priority than
.B DINO_HOME.
.B DINO_EXTERN_LIBS.
.IP DINO_EXTERN_LIBS
If not null, it defines paths of additional Dino external libraries.
The libraries should be separated by ":" (on Unix) or ";" (on Windows).
The value has less priority than values given in
.B -L
options.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
DINO diagnostics are self-explanatory.
