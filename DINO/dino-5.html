<P>Expressions are constructs denoting rules of computation of a value
from other values by the application of <EM>operators</EM>.
Expressions consist of <EM>operands</EM> and operators.  Parentheses
may be used to express specific associations of operators and
operands.  Dino is a dynamic-typed language.  This means that a
variable can store any Dino value.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc5.1">Types and Values</A>
</H2>

<P>All Dino values are <EM>first class values</EM>, i.e. they can be
assigned to a variable, can be passed as a parameter of
a function/class, and can be returned by functions.  Operators require
operands whose values are of given type and return the value of the
result type.  Most values have a representation in Dino.  When a
value representation is encountered in an expression during the
expression evaluation, the new value is generated.</P>
<P>There are values of <EM>structured types</EM>, i.e. values which are
built from other values.  The value of a structured type may be
<EM>mutable</EM> or <EM>immutable</EM>.  A value or sub-value of a
mutable value can be changed.  An immutable value can not be changed
after its generation.  You can make a mutable value immutable as a
side effect by applying the operator <CODE>final</CODE> (the table key is
also made immutable as a side effect of writing to the table).  In all
cases, the operator returns the operand value as the result.  If you
try to change an immutable value, exception <CODE>immutable</CODE> is
generated.  You can make a new mutable value as a side effect of
applying operator <CODE>new</CODE>.  The operator returns a new value
equal to the operand value.

          Expr = final  Expr
               | new  Expr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Structured value types are also <EM>shared value types</EM>.  This
notion means that if two or more different variables (array elements
or table elements or keys) refer to the same value and the value is
changed through one variable, the value which is referred through the
other variables is changed too.  There is no difference between the
notion "the same value" and the notion "equal values" for non-shared
type values.  For the shared type operands, equality means that the
operands have the same structure (e.g. vectors with the same length)
and the corresponding element values are the same.</P>

<LI><EM>vector</EM>.  This is a structured shared type
value.  A vector value is represented by a list of values
(or expressions) in brackets with optional repetitions of
the vector elements preceded by <CODE>:</CODE>.  The
repetition value is converted into an integer value by
default.  If the repetition value after the conversion is
not integer, exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is generated. If
the repetition value is negative or zero, the element
value will be absent in the vector.  Elements of vector
are accessed by their indexes.  Indexes always starts with
0.  Vectors in Dino are heterogenous, i.e. elements of a
vector may be of different types.  A string represents an
immutable vector all of whose elements are characters in
the string.  Elements of mutable vectors can be added to
or removed from the vector (see predefined functions
<EM>ins, insv, and del</EM>).

value.  A table value is represented keyword tab, followed
by a list of key values (expression values) in brackets
<CODE>[</CODE> and <CODE>]</CODE> with optional element values
with a preceding <CODE>:</CODE>.  By default the element value
is equal to <CODE>nil</CODE>.  It is not allowed to have
elements with equal keys in a table.  If it is not true in
a table constructor, exception <CODE>keyvalue</CODE> is
generated.  Elements of tables are accessed by their keys.
Elements of mutable tables can be added to or removed from
the table correspondingly by assigning values and with the
aid of the function <EM>del</EM>.  The side effect of the
table constructor execution is that the keys become
immutable.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc5.2">Designators</A>
</H2>

<P>There is a special Dino construction called a <EM>designator</EM>.  A
designator refers for a vector or table element or for a declaration.
If the designator refers to a vector or table element or for a
variable declaration, it can stand in the left hand side of an
assignment statement.  If the designator stands in an expression, the
corresponding value is used (vector/table element value, variable
value, function, thread-function, or class).  When the designator
referring to table element stands up in the left hand side of an
assignment statement, <EM>its key becomes immutable</EM>.</P>
<P>A designator referring to a vector or table element has the following
syntax:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           Designator = (Designator | Call) "["  Expr "]"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The value of the construction before the brackets must be a vector or table.
Otherwise, the exception <CODE>indexop</CODE> is generated.</P>
<P>If the value of the construction before the brackets is a vector, the
value of expression in the brackets (so called the <EM>index</EM>) is
converted to integer.  If this is not possible,
exception <CODE>indextype</CODE> is generated.  If the index is negative
or greater than or equal to the vector length, the
exception <CODE>indexvalue</CODE> is generated.  The value of the
designator will be the vector element value with given index (the
indexes starts with zero).  Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          vector [1]
          vector ["1"]
          vector [1.0]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If the value of the construction before the brackets is a table, the
value of expression in the brackets is called the <EM>key</EM>.
The value of the designator will be the table element value with the
key which is equal to given key.  If the element with the given key is
absent in the table, exception <CODE>keyvalue</CODE> is generated.
Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          table ['c']
          table [10]
          table ["1"]
          table [1.0]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The remaining forms of designator refer to a declaration.  See section
<EM>Declarations and Scope Rules</EM> for a description on how they
work.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Designator = (Designator | Call) "."  IDENT
                     | IDENT
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          value
          value.f
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Dino also has an extended form of the designator described above.
This form is called <EM>vector slice</EM>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Expr = ExtDesignator

          ExtDesignator = Designator {Slice}

          Slice = "["  [Expr] ":" [Expr] [":" Expr] "]"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Slice is applied to a vector, otherwise exception <CODE>sliceform</CODE>
is generated.  Slice refers for a part of vector given by start index,
bound, and the step.  If they are not integer,
exception <CODE>slicetype</CODE> is generated.</P>
<P>The negative bound means counting index from the vector
end.  <CODE>-1</CODE> corresponds to the vector length, <CODE>-2</CODE>
corresponds to the vector length - 1, <CODE>-3</CODE> corresponds to the
vector length -2, and so on.  If the bound is more than the vector
length, the bound is assumed to be equal to the vector length.  If the
bound is omitted, it is believed to be equal <CODE>-1</CODE>, or in other
words, to the vector length.</P>
<P>If the start index is less than zero, exception <CODE>sliceform</CODE> is
generated.  The same happens if the step is zero.  If the start index
is omitted, it is believed to be zero.  If the step is omitted, it is
believed to be one.</P>
<P>The slice refers to vector elements with
indexes <CODE>start</CODE>, <CODE>start + abs (step)</CODE>, <CODE>start + 2 *
abs (step)</CODE>, <CODE>start + 3 * abs (step)</CODE> and so on while the
index is less than the bound.  If the step is negative, the elements
are considered in the reverse order.
Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          v[:]    // all vector elements
          v[1:]   // all vector elements except the first one
          v[:-2]  // all vector elements except the last one
          v[::-1] // all vector elements in reverse order
          v[0::2] // all vector elements with even indexes
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>More one slice can be given after the designator.  In this case, next
slice is applicable to each element of the previous slice.  That means that
each element and the next slice should abide by the above rules.  The
first slice is called the first <EM>dimension</EM> slice, the second one is
called the second dimension slice and so on.
Examples of multi-dimensional slices:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          m[:][:]     // all matrix elements
          m[:][::2]   // matrix elements with even columns
          m[::2][::]  // matrix elements with even rows
          m[::2][::]  // matrix elements with even rows and columns
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Slices are actually not real reference values.  They can be considered
as an attribute which exists in a statement at most.  If vector with
slices is an operand of an operation which has a slice variant, the
operation is applied to each element of the vector referenced by the
slices in given order.  The result is a new vector with the same
dimension slices referencing all elements with the step equal to one.</P>
<P>When vector with slices is an operand of an operation, the new vector
consisting of elements referenced by the slices is created.  The new
vector will have the same dimension slices referencing for all new
vector elements with the step equal one.  This is done to avoid
side-effects of function-calls inside a statement with slices.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc5.3">Calls</A>
</H2>

<P>One form of expression is the call of a function, thread-function, or
class.  The value of the designator before the actual parameters
should be a function, thread-function, or class.  Otherwise, the
exception <CODE>callop</CODE> is generated.  An instance of the block
corresponding to the body of the function, thread-function, or class
is created.  The actual parameter values are assigned to the
corresponding formal parameters.  If the corresponding function,
thread-function, or class has no default formal parameter
<CODE>args</CODE> (see section <EM>Declarations</EM>), the remaining
actual parameter values are ignored.  Otherwise, a vector whose
elements are the remaining parameter values is created and assigned to
the parameter <CODE>args</CODE>.  If there is no corresponding actual
parameter for a formal parameter, the default parameter value (see
section <EM>Declarations</EM>) is assigned to the formal parameter.
Otherwise, the value is undefined. Then statements in the block are
executed.  If it is the call of a thread-function, a new execution
thread is created, and the statements of the block is executed in the
new thread.  The value of call of the thread-function is the
corresponding thread.  It is returned before starting the execution of
statements in the new thread.</P>
<P>Execution of the body is finished by reaching the block end or by
execution of a return-statement.  Finishing of the thread-function
results in finishing the corresponding thread.  The return-statement
in a thread-function or in class should be without an expression.  The
call of a class returns the created object.  A function call returns
the value of the expression in the executed return-statement.
Otherwise, the function return value is undefined.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc5.4">Operators</A>
</H2>

<P>Expressions consist of operands and operators.  The order in which
operators are executed in an expression is defined by their
<EM>priority</EM> and <EM>associativity</EM> of operators.  That means
that the expression <CODE>a op1 b op2 c</CODE> when the operator
<CODE>op2</CODE> has higher priority than <CODE>op1</CODE> is analogous to
<CODE>a op1 (b op2 c)</CODE>.  Dino operators have analogous priorities to
the ones in C language.  The following Dino operators are placed in
the order of their priority (the higher the line on which the operator
is placed, the higher its priority).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

All binary operators have left associativity in Dino.  That means that
the expression <CODE>a op1 b op2 c</CODE> when operators <CODE>op1</CODE> and
<CODE>op2</CODE> have the same priority is analogous to <CODE>(a op1 b) op2
c</CODE>.  Parentheses may be used to express specific associations of
operators and operands.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Expr = "(" Expr ")"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Most of the Dino operators require the operands to be of given types.
If an operand is not of given type, the conversion of it into the type
needed may be made.  If after the possible conversions the operands
are still not of necessary types, exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is
generated (when something about exceptions in this case is not
mentioned).  The following conversions may be made by default:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Integer conversion</EM>.  If the operand is a character,
its code becomes integer.  If the operand is a long integer, it
becomes integer.  If the long integer requires more 64 bits,
exception <CODE>opvalue</CODE> is generated.  If the operand is a
floating point number, its fractional part is thrown away and
integral part becomes integer.  If the operand is a vector of
characters, the corresponding string is believed to be the
decimal representation of integer and is converted into the
corresponding integer.  If the corresponding string is not a
correct integer representation, the result is undefined.  If the
corresponding string represents an integer whose representation
requires more 64 bits, exception <CODE>erange</CODE> may be
generated.  In all remaining cases the results of conversion
coincide with the operand.</LI>
<LI><EM>Arithmetic conversion</EM>.  Analogous to integer
conversion except for that the conversion of long integer or
float pointing number to integer is not made and if the string
represents a long integer (i.e. contains suffix <CODE>l</CODE>
or <CODE>L</CODE>) or a floating point number (i.e. contains an
exponent or fraction), the result will be the corresponding long
integer or floating point number instead of integer.  If the
result of conversion to integer from the string is out of range
of 64-bit representation or the result of conversion to
floating-point number from the string is out of IEEE double
format range, the exception <CODE>erange</CODE> may be generated.
<P>Additionally if the operand is in a non-short circuit binary
operator (non-logical operators) and another operand is a
floating point number after the conversion, the first operand is
converted into a floating point number too.  In this case, if
the firts operand is a long integer out of IEEE double format
range, the result is undefined.  Otherwise, if another operand
is a long integer after the conversion, the first operand is
converted into long integer too.</P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>String conversion</EM>.  If the operand is a character,
the result will be a new string (immutable vector of characters)
with one element which is the character.  If the operand is an
integer, long integer, or a floating point number, the result
will be a new string of characters which is a decimal string
representation of the number (long will have no suffix).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Logical operators</H3>

<P>Logical operators produce the integer result 1 which means
<EM>true</EM> or 0 which means <EM>false</EM>.  Logical `or'
<CODE>||</CODE> and logical `and' <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> are <EM>short circuit</EM>
operators.  That means that the second operand is evaluated depending
on the result of the first operand.  When the operands of the
operators are evaluated, the arithmetic conversion is made.</P>
<P>If the first operand of logical `or' is nonzero (integer, long
integer, or floating point), the result will be 1.  Otherwise, the
second operand is evaluated.  If the second operand is nonzero, the
result will be 1.  Otherwise, the result will be 0.</P>
<P>If the first operand of logical `and' is zero (integer, long integer,
or floating point), the result will be 0.  Otherwise, the second
operand is evaluated.  If the second operand is nonzero, the result
will be 1.  Otherwise, the result will be 0.</P>
<P>Logical negation `!' makes impilict integer conversion of the operand.
If the operand is zero (integer, long integer or floating point), the
result will be 1.  Otherwise, the result will be 0.</P>
<P>Operator <CODE>in</CODE> checks that there is an element with the given
key (the first operand) in the given table (the second operand).  If
the element is in the table, the result will be 1.  Otherwise the
result will be 0.  If the second operand is not a table, exception
<CODE>keyop</CODE> is generated.

is made) and return an integer result.  Operators <CODE>| ^ &amp; ~</CODE>
denote correspondingly bitwise or, bitwise exclusive or, bitwise and,
and bitwise negation of 64-bit integers.</P>
<P>Operators <CODE>&lt;&lt; >>> >></CODE> denote correspondingly logical left bit
shift, logical right bit shift, and arithmetic (with sign extension)
right bit shift of given number (the first operand) by given number of
bits (the second operand).  The value of the second operand must be
non-negative, otherwise the result is undefined.

<H3>Comparison operators</H3>

<P>All comparison operators return a logical value (integer 0 which
means false or integer 1 which means true).</P>
<P>Operators equality <CODE>==</CODE> and inequality <CODE>!=</CODE> may make
some conversion of the operands.  If one of the two operands is
string, then the string conversion is applied to the other operand
before the comparison.  Otherwise, standard arithmetic conversion is
applied to the operands.  The operators do not generate exceptions
(but the conversions may).  The operands are equal if they have the
same type and equal values (see section <EM>Types and Values</EM>).
For instances, functions and classes, the equality requires also the
same context.</P>
<P>Operator identity <CODE>===</CODE> or unidentity <CODE>!==</CODE> returns 1
if the operands have (or not) the same value or 0 otherwise.  The
operators never generate exceptions.</P>
<P>By default the arithmetic conversion is applied to the operands of
operators <CODE>&lt; > &lt;= >=</CODE>.  There is no exception if the operands
after the conversion are of integer, long integer, or floating point
type.  So the operands should be characters, integers, long integers,
floating point numbers, or strings representing integers, long
integers, or floating point numbers.

<H3>Arithmetic operators</H3>

<P>The following operators return integer, long integer, or floating

conversion is made on the operands.  The binary operators <CODE>+ - * /
%</CODE> denote correspondingly integer, long integer, or floating point
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and evaluation of
remainder.  Unary operator
<CODE>-</CODE> denotes arithmetic negation.  The unary operator <CODE>+</CODE>
is given for symmetry and it returns simply the operand after the
conversion.  It can be used for conversion of a string into an
integer, a long integer, or floating point number.

<H3>Miscellaneous operators</H3>

<P>The Dino conditional expression is analogous to the C language one.
Implicit arithmetic conversion is made for the first expression
followed by <CODE>?</CODE>.  If the value of the expression is non zero
(integer, long integer, or floating point), the second expression with
following
<CODE>:</CODE> is evaluated and it will be the result of the condition
expression.  Otherwise, the third expression is evaluated and it
becomes the result.</P>
<P>The operator <CODE>#</CODE> can be applied to a vector or a table.  It returns
the length of the vector or the number of elements in the table.</P>
<P>The operator <CODE>@</CODE> denotes concatenation of two vectors into a new
vector.  Before the concatenation implicit string conversion of the
operands is made.</P>
<P>The remaining operators look like function calls.  Operator
<CODE>type</CODE> returns the expression type.  Never is exception
generation possible during the operator evaluation.</P>
<P>The operator <CODE>char</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into a
character.  First, implicit integer conversion is applied to the
operand.  The operand should be an integer after the conversion.
Otherwise, exception <CODE>optype</CODE> will be generated.  The integer
is transformed into the character with the corresponding code.  If the
code is too big to be a character or is negative, exception
<CODE>erange</CODE> is generated.</P>
<P>The operator <CODE>int</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into an
integer.  Implicit integer conversion is applied to the operand.  The
operand should be an integer after the conversion.  Otherwise,
exception <CODE>optype</CODE> will be generated.  If the code is too big
to be an integer, exception <CODE>erange</CODE> is generated.</P>
<P>The operator <CODE>float</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into
floating-point number.  The first, implicit arithmetic conversion is
applied to the operand.  The operand should be an integer, an long
integer, or a floating-point number after the conversion.  Otherwise,
exception
<CODE>optype</CODE> will be generated.  Integer is transformed the
corresponding floating-point number.  The same is done for long
integer but if the number is too big or too small to be a
floating-point number, the result is undefined.</P>
<P>The operator <CODE>vec</CODE> is used for conversion of a value into a
vector.  First, implicit string conversion is applied to the operand.
The optional second expression defines the format used only for the
string conversion of a character, an integer, a long integer, a
floating point number, or a string.  The second parameter value should
be a string after implicit string conversion.  The format should not
be given for a table.  The first operand should be a table or a vector
after conversion.  The table is transformed into a new vector which
consists of pairs (one pair for each element in the table).  The first
element of the pair is a key of the corresponding element, and the
second one is the element itself.  The order of pairs in the result
vector is undefined.</P>
<P>The operator <CODE>tab</CODE> is used to conversion of a value into
table.  First, string conversion is applied to the operand.  The
operand should be a vector or a table after the conversion.  The
vector is transformed into a new table whose elements are equal to the
vector elements that have integer keys equal to the corresponding
vector indexes.

<H3>Slice Operators</H3>

<P>There are slice variants of all operators of mentioned above except
for short circuit operators <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> and <CODE>||</CODE> and
conditional expression.</P>
<P>For unary operators, operator execution on slices creates a new
vector structure consisting of elements referenced by the slices in
given order, creates the same dimension slices referencing all elements of the new
vector structure and execute the operator on each element of the
created slices which will be the result of the operator.  Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          var v = [1, 2, "3"], m = [[1, 2.], [3, 4, 5]];
          ! v[:];
          - m[1:][::2];
          float (m[:][:]);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Binary operators on slices are a bit more complicated.  If the both
operands have slices, they should have the same <EM>form</EM>
(dimension, number of elements in each corresponding sub-vector
referenced by the slices), otherwise <CODE>sliceform</CODE> exception is
generated.  The operator execution can be considered as creating a new
vector structure consisting of elements referenced by the slices in
and creating the same dimension slices referencing all elements of the
new vector structure.  The same is done for the second slice.  Than
the elements of the new vector structure created for the first operand
is changed by the result of the operator applied to this element and
the corresponding element from the slices created for the second
operand.  The slices created for the first operand will be the result.  Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          var v = [1, 2, 3], m = [[4, 5], [6, 7]];
          v[:] * v[:];
          m[:][0::2] + m[:][1::2];
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If only one operand has the slices, the operator execution can be
considered as creating a new vector structure consisting of elements
referenced by the slices and creating the same dimension slice
referencing all elements of the new vector structure.  Than the
elements of the new vector structure is changed by the result of the
operator applied to this element and another operand in given operand
order.  The created slices will be the result.  Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          var v = [1, 2, 3], m = [[4, 5], [6, 7]];
          1 - v[:];
          v[:] * v[:] * 2;
          m[:][0::2] + 1;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Dino has additional unary operators which work only on slices:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Expr = ".+"  Expr
               | ".*"  Expr
               | ".&amp;"  Expr
               | ".^"  Expr
               | ".|"  Expr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The are called <EM>fold operators</EM>.  If the operand has no
slices, exception <CODE>vecform</CODE> is generated.  The operator execution
is to apply the corresponing non-fold operator to all elements
referenced by the slices.  Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          var v = [1, 2, 3], m = [[4, 5], [6, 7]];
          .+ v[:];
