<P>DINO is a high level dynamic-typed scripting language.  DINO is
designed taking such design principles as simplicity, uniformity, and
expressiveness into account.  Dino is oriented on the same domain of
applications as the famous scripting languages Perl, TCL, and Python.
Most programmers know the C programming language.  Therefore Dino aims
to look like C where it is possible.  Dino is an object oriented
language with garbage collection.  Dino has possibilities of
concurrency execution and exception handling.  Dino is an extensible
language with the possibility of dynamic loading of libraries written
on other languages.  The high level structures of Dino are
<UL>
<LI>heterogenous extensible vectors</LI>
<LI>extensible associative tables with the ability to delete
table elements</LI>
<LI>objects</LI>
</UL>

<P>Originally, Dino was used in the russian graphics company ANIMATEK for
description of the movement of dinosaurs in a project.  It has been
considerably redesigned and was implemented with the aid of the COCOM
tool set.</P>
<P>This document is not intended for use as a programmer's tutorial.  It
is a concise description of the language DINO and can be used as a
programmer's reference.</P>
