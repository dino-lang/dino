NAME
       dino - the interpreter of the programming language Dino

SYNOPSIS
       dino  [  -h  -s  -t -m size -Idirname -Lpath -O --save-temps -d -p] (-c
       program | program-file | -i dump-file ) dino-program-arguments

DESCRIPTION
       dino interprets a program in the Dino programming language.   The  pro‐
       gram file (and include files) must have the suffix .d

       The  description  of  Dino language is in the report of the Programming
       Language Dino.

OPTIONS
       Calling the interpreter without arguments is to call REPL (an  interac‐
       tive  environment  for  execution  of  Dino statements and printing the
       results of the statement execution).  The options which the Dino inter‐
       preter recognizes are:

       -c program
              Execute  the Dino program given on the command line as the argu‐
              ment.

       -h     Output information about Dino command line options.

       -m number
              Determine the size of the heap chunks used by  the  Dino  inter‐
              preter.   The  size can be given in bytes (e.g. 32000), in kilo‐
              bytes (e.g. 64k), or in megabytes (e.g. 1m).  The  default  size
              is  1  Megabyte.   Initially,  the  Dino interpreter creates one
              chunk.  It allocates one additional chunk (as rule of  the  same
              size)  whenever there is no additional memory after garbage col‐
              lection.

       -s     Output some statistics of interpreter work into stderr.  Statis‐
              tics  contain  the maximal heap size, number of heap chunks, and
              number of collisions in hash  tables  which  are  used  for  the
              implementation of Dino tables.

       -t     Output  information  about call stack of the program into stderr
              for unprocessed exception or calling exit function.  This output
              sometimes can be different from what people would expect because
              of tail call elimination.

       -Idirname
              Define the  directory  in  which  Dino  include  files  will  be
              searched  for.  The order of searching in directories given with
              this option is the same as the one on the command line.

       -Ldirname
              Define  where  to  search  for  external  libraries  (if  shared
              libraries  are  implemented  on  the  system.   This is true for
              Linux, Solaris, Irix, OSF, and Windows) in which the Dino exter‐
              nal  variables and functions will be searched for.  The order of
              searching in libraries given with this option is the same as one
              on the command line.

       -O     Do type inference and byte code specialization.  It can speed up
              the program execution, especially when JIT is used.

       -d     Output Dino byte code to the standard output.

       -i     Read Dino byte code from a given file and execute it.   You  can
              use this option instead of providing Dino program file.

       --save-temps
              If  a  Dino  function processed by JIT compiler, the generated C
              source code and PIC object code can  be  saved  after  finishing
              Dino  interpreter  in directory /tmp with this option.  The file
              names will contain identifier number of the  corresponding  Dino
              interpreter process.

       -p     Output  profile  information  into  stderr.  Profile information
              contains the number of calls and execution times of  all  called
              functions and classes.

FILES
       file.d
              a Dino program file
       libdino.so
              a Dino shared library on some Unix systems.
       ieee.d
              the  Dino  file implementing IEEE standard floating point arith‐
              metic.
       ieee.so
              the Dino shared library used for implementing IEEE on some  Unix
              systems.
       ipcerr.d
              the  Dino  file  definining  exceptions of ipc/network software.
              This file is used by socket.d.
       ipcerr.so
              the Dino shared library used for  implementing  IPCERR  on  some
              Unix systems.
       socket.d
              the Dino file implementing work with sockets.
       socket.so
              the  Dino  shared  library  used for implementing SOCKET on some
              Unix systems.
       Dino interpreter creates temporary C and object files  for  Dino  func‐
       tions processed by JIT compiler in directory /tmp.

ENVIRONMENT
       There  are the following environment variables which affect Dino behav‐
       ior:

       DINO_HOME
              If not null, it defines the places of the dino shared  libraries
              (such a library may be only on some Unix systems including Linux
              and  Solaris),  include  files,  and  dino   standard   external
              libraries.   The  places  are defined as the subdirectory lib in
              directory given by the environment variable value.   You  should
              define  the variable value on Windows if you installed the files
              in a directory other than C:\dino\lib

       DINO_PATH
              If not null, it defines the places of dino  include-files.   The
              value  of the variable has more priority than DINO_HOME but less
              priority than values given through -I options.

       DINO_LIB
              If not null, it defines places of dino shared library,  if  any.
              The   value  of  variable  has  more  priority  than  DINO_HOME.
              DINO_EXTERN_LIBS.

       DINO_EXTERN_LIBS
              If not null,  it  defines  paths  of  additional  Dino  external
              libraries.   The  libraries should be separated by ":" (on Unix)
              or ";" (on Windows).  The value has less  priority  than  values
              given in -L options.

DIAGNOSTICS
       DINO diagnostics are self-explanatory.
