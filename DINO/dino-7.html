<P>Statements denote actions.  There are <EM>simple</EM> and
<EM>compound</EM> statements.  Simple statements do not consist of any
parts that are statements themselves.  They are the assignment,
procedure call, return, break, continue, throw, and the wait
statements.  Analogous to the C language the last symbol of a Dino
simple statement is semicolon <CODE>;</CODE>.  Compound statements
consists of parts that are statements themselves.  They are used to
express sequencing, exception handling, conditional, and repetitive
execution.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.1">Empty statement</A>
</H2>

<P>There is also the empty statement in Dino.  It denotes no action.  The
empty statement is included in Dino for convenience.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.2">Block-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>A block-statement is simply a block and can used to group statements
into one statement and/or describe local declarations.  For details on
how the block is executed see section <EM>Declaration and Scope
Rules</EM>.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.3">Expression-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>Dino has an expression statement.  Although it seems that the
expression value is not used, the expression evaluation can results in
side-effects, e.g. through calling a function/class.
Expression-statement as the last statement in the function block means
return of the expression value as the function call result.  In REPL
(see Appendix B. Implementation), execution of an expression-statement
results in printing the expression value.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.4">Assignment statements</A>
</H2>

<P>Assignment-statements are used to change variable values or element
values of a structured value which are referred through a designator
(see sub-section <EM>Designator</EM> in section <EM>Expressions</EM>.
The designator can not denote a final variable (see section
<EM>Variable Declaration</EM>).  You can not change the element value
of an immutable value (see section <EM>Types and Values</EM>).  In
this case exception <CODE>immutable</CODE> is generated.  Assignment to a
table element has a side effect, the element key becomes immutable.</P>
<P>A simple assignment statement looks like <CODE>Designator = Expr;</CODE>.
That means that the expression value is assigned to variable or
element of structured type value denoted by the designator.  For the
convenience of C programmers there are also the Dino assignments
<CODE>Designator op= Expr;</CODE>, <CODE>Designator++;</CODE>,
<CODE>++Designator;</CODE>, <CODE>Designator--;</CODE>, and
<CODE>--Designator;</CODE>.  They are analogous correspondingly to
<CODE>Designator = Designator op Expr;</CODE>, <CODE>Designator = Designator
+ 1;</CODE>, and <CODE>Designator = Designator - 1;</CODE>.  The only
difference is in the fact that the designator is evaluated only once,
not twice as in the analogous form.  It is important to know if you
have <EM>side effects</EM> in the statement.

          i *= 20;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If the designator is a slice and the expression value is a slice too,
they both should have the same <EM>form</EM>,
otherwise <CODE>sliceform</CODE> exception is generated.  In this case
each element referenced by the designator slice gets value of the
corresponding element referenced by the expression slice.  If the
designator is a slice but the expression value is not, each element
referenced by the designator slice gets the expression value.  Examples
of the slice assignment:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          v = [1, 2, 3, 4];
          v[:] += 1;

<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.5">If-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>The Dino if-statement is analogous to the C language one.  First, the
expression after <CODE>if</CODE> is evaluated and arithmetic conversion is
done to it.  The value should be an integer, a long integer, or a
floating-point number, otherwise the exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is
generated.  If the value is nonzero the first statement is executed,
otherwise the statement after <CODE>else</CODE> is executed (if any).  The
problem with
<EM>dangling else</EM> is resolved analogous to the C language --
<CODE>else</CODE> is associated with the closest <CODE>if</CODE>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.6">For-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>The Dino for-statement is analogous to the C language one.  The
statement is executed in the following way.
<OL>
<LI>Execution of the first statement in the parentheses.</LI>
<LI>The expression (<EM>for-guard</EM>) is evaluated and
implicit arithmetic conversion is made.  The value should be
an integer, a long integer, or a floating point number.  If
this is not true, exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is generated.</LI>
<LI>If the value of for-guard is nonzero, the body of the loop
(the last statement) is executed.  Otherwise, the
for-statement execution finishes.</LI>
<LI>When the body has been executed, the second statement in
the parentheses is executed and steps 2,3,4 (one iteration) are
repeated.</LI>
</OL>

If the second statement is a simple statement, the statement semicolon
can be omitted.  The for-statement also can be finished by execution
of the statement <CODE>break</CODE> in the body.  The body can be finished
by execution of statement <CODE>continue</CODE>.  In this case, the
for-statement execution continues with the step 4.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.7">Foreach-statement</A>
</H2>

<P>This statement is used to execution of the foreach-statement body (the
statement) for all keys of table which is value of the expression.
The expression value should be a table.  If this is not true,
exception <CODE>keyop</CODE> is generated.  The current key value on each
iteration is assigned to the designator.  The order in which the key
values are assigned on each iteration is undefined.  One iteration can
be finished with the aid of the statement <CODE>continue</CODE> and a
foreach-statement can be finished by execution of statement
<CODE>break</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.8">Match-statements</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two kinds of match-statement.  One is used for pattern
matching and another one is used for regular expression matching.
They have practically the same syntax.  They differ in usage of
different start keywords <CODE>pmatch</CODE> and <CODE>rmatch</CODE>
correspondingly for pattern and regular expression matching.</P>
<P>The pattern or regular expression match statement is used to try
matching match-expression value (it is evaluated only once) and the
patterns or regular expressions in given order and execute the
statements corresponding to the first matched case.</P>
<P>Each case forms an own scope.  Pattern variables in pattern match
statement are declared in the corresponding case scope.  Each case
scope of regular expression match statement contains implicitly
declared variable <CODE>m</CODE>.  If the case regular expression
successfully matches the match-expression, value of the corresponding
variable <CODE>m</CODE> is vector of indexes describing matched substring
(see the result of function <CODE>match</CODE> for details).</P>
<P>In case of regular expression matching the string conversion is
implicitly applied to the match-expression and the case expression
values.  The exception <CODE>optype</CODE> occurs if the conversion
results are not strings.  Case with wildcard <CODE>_</CODE> also can occur
in rmatch-statement.  Matching with such case is always successful but
value of variable <CODE>m</CODE> is undefined in this case.</P>
<P>Execution of continue-statement in case-statements results in
continuing the process of matching match-expression value with the
subsequent patterns or regular expressions.  Execution of
break-statement in case-statements results in finishing the
match-statement execution.  There is implicit break at the end of each
case statement list.</P>
<P>If optional case condition is given, then it is evaluated after
succesfull matching with the corresponding pattern and arithmetic
conversion is done to it.  The value should be an integer, a long
integer, or a floating-point number, otherwise the
exception <CODE>optype</CODE> is generated.  If the value is nonzero the
all match is considered successfull, otherwise the subsequent case
patterns are tried.

<P>Return-statement is used to finish execution of a function, a thread,
or class block.  The statement corresponds to the closest-containing
function, thread-function, or class covering the statement, so the
return-statement can be placed only in a function, a function-thread,
or a class.  The expression in a return-statement can be given only

<H2><A NAME="ss7.12">7.12</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc7.12">Try-block</A>
</H2>

<P>Exceptions can be generated by the Dino interpreter when some
conditions are not satisfied, by predeclared Dino functions, by other
OS processes, by user interruptions, or by the user with the aid of a
throw-statement.  Actually, the exceptions are represented by an
object of the predeclared class <CODE>except</CODE> or by an object of a
class declared inside the predeclared class <CODE>except</CODE>.  All
predeclared exceptions are described in the section <EM>Predeclared
Identifiers</EM>.  To detect and process exceptions, a try-block can
be used.</P>
<P>When an exception is generated, the closest-containing try-block which
is covering the statement generating the exception or currently being
executed (when this is is generated by an OS process or by an user
interruption) is searched for.  Then, expressions in the catch list
elements are processed.  The expression value in the catch list
element being currently processed should be the predeclared class
<CODE>except</CODE> or a class declared inside the predeclared class
<CODE>except</CODE>.  If the expression being processed is a class and the
exception is an object of the class or an object of a class declared
inside the class, the block corresponding to the given catch list
element is executed.  If there is no such catch expression, the
closest-containing try-block covering the current try-block is
searched for and processing the exception is repeated.  If there are
no more try-blocks, the program finishes with a diagnostic message
which is dependent on the generated exception.</P>
<P>Blocks corresponding to catch list elements have a predeclared
