<P>A Dino program is block structured.  Each block introduces a new
identifier scope.  A block consists of executive statements and
declarations and may contain nested blocks.  There are also implicit
blocks containing each case-part of switch statements (see
below). Each identifier used in a program should be declared in a
declaration in the program, unless it is a predeclared identifier.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Block = "{"  StmtList "}"

          StmtList = { Stmt }
        
          Stmt = ExecutiveStmt
               | Declaration
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

When declaring an identifier, you also specify certain permanent
properties of a declaration, such as whether it is a variable, a
function, a class, or a singleton object.  The identifier is then used
to refer to the associated declaration (more correctly with the
declaration instance).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Declaration = VarDeclarations
                      | AccessClause
                      | ExternDeclarations
                      | FuncClassDeclaration
                      | SingletonObject
                      | ForwardDeclaration
                      | IncludeDeclaration
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The scope of a declaration is textually from the point of declaration
to the end of the block to which the declaration belongs and hence to
which the declaration is local.  The declaration scope can stop
earlier at the point of another declaration with the same identifier
in the same block.  The declaration scope excludes the scopes of
declarations with the same identifier which are in nested blocks.</P>
<P>It is important to understand the notion of instantiation of the
declaration.  This notion reflects program execution, not the static
structure of program.  An instance exists in a <EM>context</EM>.
Actually, a context is an execution environment consisting of the
covering block instances and/or class objects.  A new instance of the
block is created when execution of the block starts.  There may be
more than one instance of the same block, e.g. when the block is a
function or class body (in this case the block instance is a class
object), or when the block is executed on different threads (parallel
execution branches) or when there is a reference to a block instance
after its execution.  When a new instance of the block starts, all the
block declarations are instantiated too.  For a variable declaration,
it means a new instance of variable is created in the given context.
For a function or class declaration, it means that the function or
class is bound to the given context.</P>
<P>Example: 
The following program illustrates a case when a reference to
a block instance exists after its execution.  The program
outputs the result 8.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          var i, f;
        
          for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
            if (i % 4 == 0)
              {
                var j = i;
                fun r () {return j;}
                f = r;
              }
          putln (f ());
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>There are certain rules for declaration accessibility.  Declaration is
always either <EM>private</EM> or <EM>public</EM>.  Private
declaration is accessible only inside the declaration scope or inside
functions or classes which are declared as <EM>friend</EM> in the
declaration block.  A public declaration instance is always accessible
when association (see below) of the identifier is successful.  By
default, (instances of) declarations in a class block are public.  In
all other places, the (instances of) declarations are private by
default.  The following constructions are used for declaring an
identifier to be a friend:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          FriendClause = friend IDENT { "," IDENT } ";"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          friend class2;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Association of an identifier and the corresponding declaration
instance is performed by the following rules:
<UL>
<LI>The corresponding declaration instance is searched for a
separate identifier occurrence in the instance of the block in
which the identifier occurs.  The identifier should be in the scope
of the corresponding declaration.  If there is no such declaration, the
declaration is searched in the covering block instance of the
current block instance back from the current block, and so on.
In any case, the identifier should be in the scope of the
corresponding declaration.</LI>
<LI>Declaration instance for an identifier in the following
construction
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       designator.identifier
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is searched in the block instance (e.g. in a class object)
whose value is in the designator.  The scope of the found
declaration should always include the block end.  The
exception <CODE>accessop</CODE> occurs if the declaration is not
found with such identifier, or the declaration is private and
the construction is not inside a friend of the declaration
scope.</LI>
</UL>

The following identifiers are predeclared on the top level (in the
implicit block covering the whole program).  They are described in
more detail later in the report.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc4.1">Variable Declarations</A>
</H2>

<P>Dino is an imperative language. In other words it has
<EM>variables</EM> which are named containers of values.  A variable
can contain any value.  This means that DINO is a dynamically-typed
language.  The declaration of a variable also may define the initial
value of the variable.  In this case a <EM>pattern</EM> can stand on
the left side of the assignment instead of just an identifier.  The
pattern should contain at least one variable.  The pattern variables
are declared at the assignment point.  Pattern should match the
assigned value, otherwise exception <CODE>patternmatch</CODE> is
generated.  Details about patterns, pattern variables, and pattern
matching is decribed later in this document.</P>
<P>Assigning of the initial value to the variable instance is made after
execution of the previous statements of the block and after execution
of previous assignments in the variable list.  By default the initial
value of variables is undefined.  Nothing can be done with this value.
This value even can not be stored.</P>
<P>The value of the variable can not be changed after its initialization
if its declaration is in a list starting with keyword <CODE>val</CODE>.</P>
<P>Keywords <CODE>pub</CODE> and <CODE>priv</CODE> can be used to redefine the
default accessibility.  They make the declared variables
correspondingly public and private.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc4.2">External Declarations</A>
</H2>

<P>Dino permits to use functions written in other languages, e.g. C.  The
functions should have special prototypes and must have to access to
the DINO standard procedural interface (SPI).  Dino can also have
access to variables of a special type declared in the source code in
another language.  The details of the implementation of such features
and the DINO SPI are not described here (some details are given in
appendix B).  As rule, the external functions and variables will be
implemented as dynamically loaded libraries.  This is the powerful
instrument of DINO extension.  The external functions and variables
are declared after keyword <CODE>extern</CODE>.  An external function
identifier is followed by <CODE>()</CODE>.  All external declarations
(e.g. in different blocks) with the same identifier refer the the same
external function or variable.  As in variable declaration,
keywords <CODE>pub</CODE> and <CODE>priv</CODE> can be used to redefine the
default accessibility.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc4.3">Functions and Classes</A>
</H2>

<P>A function/class declaration consists of a
function/class <EM>header</EM>, <EM>formal parameters</EM>, and a
function/class block (body).  The header specifies the function/class
identifier.</P>
<P>A function can return the result with the aid of the
statement <EM>return</EM>.  If the result value after the
keyword <EM>return</EM> is absent or the return statement is not
executed, the function result is undefined.  Expression-statement as
the last statement in the function block is actually abbreviation of
return with the expression.</P>
<P>A class call returns the class block instance (an <EM>object</EM> of
the class).  The return-statement for classes must be without a result.</P>
<P><EM>Thread-functions</EM> are analogous to general functions.  The
difference is in that a new execution thread (<EM>process</EM>) is
created during the thread-function call, the return-statement inside
thread-function must be without an expression, and the thread-function
returns the corresponding process.  The process finishes when the
corresponding thread block finishes.  Processes are executed
concurrently.  Originally only one process (called the <EM>main
thread</EM>) exists in a DINO program.</P>
<P>The formal parameters are considered to be declared in a
function/class block and to be initialized by values of <EM>actual
parameters</EM> during a call of the function/class.  By default they
can change their value.  Keyword <CODE>val</CODE> prevents changing value
of the corresponding formal parameter after the initialization.</P>
<P>Default accessibility of the formal parameter can be changed by using
keywords <CODE>pub</CODE> or <CODE>priv</CODE> (see accessibility in section
"Declarations and Scope Rules").</P>
<P>The number of <EM>actual parameters</EM> should be the same as the
number of formal parameters.  There are two exclusion to this
requirement.  One exclusion is formal parameters initialized by a
default value in a way analogous to variable initialization.  The
actual parameters corresponding to the formal parameters with default
values can be omitted.  In this case, the formal parameters will have
the default value.  Another exclusion is an usage of <CODE>...</CODE> at
the end of the list of formal parameter declarations, the number of
actual parameters can be more the number of formal parameters.
Using <CODE>...</CODE> results in that the formal parameter with the
identifier <CODE>args</CODE> will be declared implicitly.  The value of
the parameter will be a vector whose elements will be the remaining
actual parameter values.  If the number of actual parameters is equal
to the number of formal parameters (not taking the implicit
parameter <CODE>args</CODE> into account), the value of <CODE>args</CODE> will
be the empty vector.</P>
<P>All formal parameters with default values should be at the end of the
parameter list.  Usage of formal parameters with default values is
prohibited in case when <CODE>...</CODE> is used.</P>
<P>If a class contains a function with the name <CODE>destroy</CODE>, the
function will be called when the class object becomes garbage during
the garbage collection process or at the end of the program.  The
function can also be called explicitly from outside if it is declared
as public.  You should remember that the function is called by the
garbage collector without actual parameters and the garbage collector
(or finishing the program) ignores the result value.  So the function
should satisfy the above rules to be called without actual parameters.</P>
<P>You may prevent removing the corresponding object by the garbage
collector in the function destroy by assigning the object to a
variable.  It means that the function can be called several times
(during several garbage collections) for the same object.  But you
should also avoid creation of objects during the call of
function <CODE>destroy</CODE> because it may result in increase of the
heap.</P>
<P>A function/class declaration can have optional qualifiers.
Qualifier <CODE>final</CODE> can not be mentioned in use-clause.
Qualifiers <CODE>pub</CODE> and <CODE>priv</CODE> changes default
accessibility of the declaration.

<P>According to Dino scope rules, a declaration should be present before
any usage of the declared identifier.  Sometimes we need to use
function/class identifier before its declaration, e.g. in the case of
mutually recursive functions.  To do this, Dino has forward
declarations.</P>
<P>A forward declaration is just a function/class header followed by
semicolon:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
            ForwardDeclaration = Header ";"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Forward declaration denotes first declaration with the same identifier
in the same block after the forward declaration.  The forward and the
corresponding declaration should be the same declaration type
(function, class, or thread), and have the same accessibility and the
same qualifier <CODE>final</CODE>.</P>
<P>The corresponding declaration may be absent.  In this case a call of
the function/class results in occuring exception <CODE>abstrcall</CODE>.
Forward declaration without the corresponding declaration can be
usefull to describe <EM>abstract classes</EM>.  The following are
examples of forward declarations:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          fun even;
          fun odd (i) { if (i == 0) return 0; return even (i - 1);}
          fun even (i) { if (i == 0) return 1; return odd (i - 1);}
          class operation { // abstract class
            fun print_op (); fun apply ();
          }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Function/class declaration may have an optimization hint.  Currently,
there are only 3 hints.  Hint <CODE>!pure</CODE> means that the function
is pure, i.e. it has no side effects and returns result depending only
on the call arguments.  Hint <CODE>!inline</CODE> means inlining the
function calls.  Hint <CODE>!jit</CODE> use JIT compiler for the
function/class.</P>

<P>Use-clause provides a safe way to support object oriented programming.
It has the following semantics:
<UL>
<LI>Declarations of class/function with identifier given in
<EM>use</EM> are inlayed.</LI>
<LI>Declarations before the use-clause rewrite corresponding
inlayed declarations mentioned in <EM>former</EM>-items.</LI>
<LI>Declarations after the use-clause rewrite corresponding
inserted declarations mentioned in <EM>later</EM>-items.</LI>
<LI>The original (rewritten) and new (rewritting) declarations
should be <EM>present</EM> if they are given in former- or
later-items.</LI>
<LI>The original and new declarations should be <EM>matched</EM>.
It means that they should be the same declaration type (variable,
function, class, thread, and external), they should have the same
accessibility, they should the same final attribute for functions,
classes, and threads.</LI>
<LI>The original rewritten declaration can be still used in the
block if it is <EM>renamed</EM>.  The declaration is renamed when a
identfier in parentheses is given.  The original declaration can be
used with this identfier.</LI>
</UL>

These rules are necessary for correct <EM>duck-typing</EM> or class
<EM>sub-typing</EM>.</P>
<P>The following example illustrates use-clause:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           class point (x, y) {
           }
           class circle (x, y, radius) {
             use point former x, y;
             fun square () {3.14 * radius * radius;}
           }
           class ellipse (x, y, radius, width) {
             use circle former x, y, radius later square;
             fun square () {
               ...
             }
           }

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="dino.html#toc4.5">Singleton Object</A>
</H2>

<P>Sometimes it is usefull to guarantee that there is only single object
(<EM>singleton object</EM>) of a class.  Although it can be achieved
by creating of object of an anonymous class (see section "Anonymous
Functions and Classes") and assigning it to a variable declared
as <CODE>val</CODE>, Dino has a special declaration for singleton object:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SingletonObject = [pub | priv] obj IDENT block
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Keywords <CODE>pub</CODE> and <CODE>priv</CODE> can be used to redefine the
default accessibility.  They make the declared object correspondingly
public and private.  Example of singleton object declaration:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           priv obj coord {
             val x = 0, y = 10;
           }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
