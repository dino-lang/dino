/* The file implements block table (Number->func_class and
   func_class -> Number) and abstract data block_decl_tables.  This
   abstract data mainly serves for access to block decl nodes by
   block_number and decl_ident_number (see commentaries for
   block and decl).  The abstract data is designed and implemented for
   implementation dynamic load another file in the future (see
   commentaries for func define_block_decl).  */
