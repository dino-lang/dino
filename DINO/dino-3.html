<P>Wherever it is possible, we use also EBNF for description of lexical
symbols through ASCII set characters.  Otherwise, we will use natural
language sentences in <CODE>&lt;</CODE> and <CODE>></CODE>.  Lexical symbols are
identifiers, numbers, character constants, strings, operators,
delimiters, and comments.  White characters (blanks and line breaks)
must not occur within the symbols (except in comments, and blanks in
strings).  White characters are ignored unless they are essential to
separate two consecutive lexical symbols.  Upper- and lower-case
letters are considered to be distinct.
<OL>
<LI>An <EM>identifier</EM> is a sequence of letters and digits
starting with a letter.  The underline is believed to be a
valid letter in an identifier.  A single underline is fixed
for other usage (see wildcard in section "Patterns").

<LI><EM>Numbers</EM> are (unsigned) integer or floating point
numbers.  Numbers start with a digit.  Numbers starting with
prefix <CODE>0x</CODE> or <CODE>0X</CODE> are hexadecimal integer
numbers.  Otherwise integer numbers starting with <CODE>0</CODE>
are octal integer numbers.  Octal integer numbers should not
contain <CODE>8</CODE> or <CODE>9</CODE>.  If an integer number has
suffix <CODE>l</CODE> or <CODE>L</CODE>, it is a long number (see long
values in section "Types and Values").  Floating point numbers
are distinguished from decimal integer numbers by the presence
of decimal point <CODE>.</CODE> or an exponent in the number.

          Number = Integer | Long | FloatingPointNumber

<LI>A Dino <EM>character constant</EM> denotes an Unicode
character.  The following sequences starting with the ASCII
backslash have a special meaning inside a Dino character
constant:
<UL>
<LI><CODE><B>\a</B>    - </CODE> ASCII character alert</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\b</B>     -</CODE> ASCII character backspace</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\f</B>     -</CODE> ASCII character form feed</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\n</B>     -</CODE> ASCII character new line</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\r</B>     -</CODE> ASCII character carriage return</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\t</B>     -</CODE> ASCII character horizontal tab</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\v</B>     -</CODE> ASCII character vertical tab</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\code</B>  -</CODE> Character with code given
up to tree octal digits</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\xcode</B> -</CODE> Character with code given
by two hexdecimal digits</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\ucode</B> -</CODE> Character with code given
by four hexdecimal digits</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\Ucode</B> -</CODE> Character with code given
by eight hexdecimal digits</LI>
<LI><CODE><B>\char</B>  -</CODE> Character char for all
remaining characters</LI>
</UL>

To denote a single quote mark use the sequence <CODE>\'</CODE>.
The double quote mark can be represented either by <CODE>\"</CODE>
or simply by <CODE>"</CODE>.  To represent a backslash inside the
character constant, use two consecutive ASCII backslashes.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Character = "'" Char "'"

          Char = &lt;any character except for the single quote ',
                  backslash \, or line break>
               | SimpleEscapeSeq
               | OctalEscapeSeq

          SimpleEscapeSeq = &lt;one of  \'  \"  \\  \a  \b  \f  \n  \r  \t  \v>

          OctalEscapeSeq = "\" OctalDigit [ OctalDigit [ OctalDigit ] ]

</LI>
<LI>A <EM>string</EM> is sequence of characters enclosed
in double quotes. There are the same sequences of
characters with special meaning as in a character constant.
To denote a double quote mark use sequence <CODE>\"</CODE>.  The
single quote mark can be represented either by <CODE>\'</CODE> or
simply by <CODE>'</CODE>.  To represent a backslash inside the
character constant, use two consecutive ASCII backslashes.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          String = '"' {Char} '"'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          "This is Dino"  "Don't worry\n"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Another variant of string representation uses
back-quotes <CODE>`</CODE>.  A character inside the back-quotes are
present in the string as it is, in other words, the escape
sequences do now work in such representation.  To denote
back-quote in such string representation use double back-qoutes.
The newline may not be in such string representation.  It
means that string with back-quotes can reside only on one line.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          String = '`' {Char} '`'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          `\p{Greek}+`  `back qoute `` is here`
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>The remaining essential symbols are called
<EM>operators</EM> and <EM>delimiters</EM>.  Operators are
used for forming expressions, delimiters are used for forming
syntax constructions.  There is a special kind of operators
and delimiters which look like identifiers containing only
lower-case letters.  They are reserved identifiers (keywords).
Keywords can not be used in the place of an identifier.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          OperatorOrDelimeter = "?" | ":" | "|" | "||" | "&amp;" | "&amp;&amp;" | "^"
                              | "==" | "!=" | "===" | "!==" | "&lt;" | ">"

</LI>
<LI><EM>Comments</EM> are considered analogous to blanks on the
syntax level of the program.  There are two types of comments.
The first type is an arbitrary character sequence starting
with <CODE>/*</CODE> and finishing with <CODE>*/</CODE>.  The second
type of comment starts with <CODE>//</CODE> and finishes with the
first line break or with the end of file.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          Comment = "/*" &lt;arbitrary char. sequence not containing pair */> "*/"
