<P>Wherever it is possible, we use also the EBNF for description of
lexical symbols through ASCII set characters.  Otherwise, we will use
natural language sentences in <CODE>&lt;</CODE> and <CODE>></CODE>.</P>
<P>Lexical symbols are identifiers, numbers, character constants,
strings, operators, delimiters, and comments.  White characters
(blanks and line breaks) must not occur within the symbols (except in
comments, and as the blanks in strings).  The white characters are
ignored unless they are essential to separate two consecutive lexical
symbols.  Upper- and lower-case letters are considered to be distinct.
<OL>
<LI>An <EM>identifier</EM> is a sequence of letters and digits
starting with a letter.  The underline is believed to be a
valid letter in an identifier.  A single underline is fixed
for other usage (see a wildcard in section "Patterns").

<LI><EM>Numbers</EM> are (unsigned) integer or floating point
numbers.  Numbers start with a digit.  Numbers starting with
the prefix <CODE>0x</CODE> or <CODE>0X</CODE> are hexadecimal integer
numbers.  Otherwise, integer numbers starting with <CODE>0</CODE>
are octal integer numbers.  Octal integer numbers should not
contain <CODE>8</CODE> or <CODE>9</CODE>.  If an integer number has
the suffix <CODE>l</CODE> or <CODE>L</CODE>, it is a long number (see
long values in the section "Types and Values").  Floating
point numbers are distinguished from decimal integer numbers
by the presence of the decimal point <CODE>.</CODE> or an exponent
in the number representation.  You can put <CODE>_</CODE> in
number digit sequences unless it is the first symbol of the
sequence.  It can be useful for readability of long digit
sequences.

<LI>A Dino <EM>character constant</EM> denotes an Unicode

backslash have a special meaning inside a Dino character
constant:

<P>To denote a single quote mark use the sequence <CODE>\'</CODE>.
The double quote mark can be represented either by <CODE>\"</CODE>

character constant, use two consecutive ASCII backslashes.

<LI>A <EM>string</EM> is a sequence of characters enclosed in
double quotes. There are the same sequences of characters with
special meaning as in a character constant.  To denote a
double quote mark use the sequence <CODE>\"</CODE>.  The single
quote mark can be represented either by <CODE>\'</CODE> or simply
by <CODE>'</CODE>.  To represent a backslash inside the character
constant, use two consecutive ASCII backslashes.

</P>
<P>Another variant of a string representation uses
back-quotes <CODE>`</CODE>.  A character inside the back-quotes
are present in the string as it is, in other words, the escape
sequences do not work in such representation.  To denote the
back-quote in such string representation use double
back-qoutes.  The newline may not be in such string
representation.  It means that a string with back-quotes can
reside only on one program line.

<LI>A <EM>C code</EM> is a sequence of characters enclosed in
the special brackets <CODE>%{</CODE> and <CODE>%}</CODE>.  It represents a
C code fragment which is compiled and loaded into Dino
interpreter during the program execution

<LI>The remaining essential lexical symbols are called
<EM>operators</EM> and <EM>delimiters</EM>.  Operators are
used for forming expressions, delimiters are used for forming
syntax constructions.  There is a special kind of operators
and delimiters which look like identifiers containing only
lower-case letters.  They are reserved identifiers (keywords).
Keywords can not be used in the place of an identifier.

<LI><EM>Comments</EM> are considered analogous to blanks on the
syntax level of the program.  There are two types of the
comments.  The first type is an arbitrary character sequence
starting with <CODE>/*</CODE> and finishing with <CODE>*/</CODE>.  The
second type comment starts with <CODE>//</CODE> and finishes with
the first line break or with the end of file.
