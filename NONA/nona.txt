  1.  Introduction

  NONA is a translator of a code selector description (CS) into code for
  solving code selection and possibly other back-end tasks. The code
  selector description is mainly intended for describing code selection
  task solution, i.e. for determining by machine-independent way a
  transformation of a low level internal representation of source
  program into machine instruction level internal representation. But
  the code selector description can be used also to locate machine
  dependent code for solving other back-end task, e.g. register
  allocation. To describe code selector description a special language
  is used.

  An code selector description describes mainly tree patterns of low
  level internal representation with associated costs and semantic
  actions. NONA generates the tree matcher which builds cover of low
  level internal representation by the tree patterns with minimal cost
  on the first bottom up pass and fulfills actions associated with the
  choiced tree patterns on the second bottom up pass. Usually the
  actions contain code to output assembler instruction.

  Analogous approach for solving code selection task is used by modern
  generator generators such as BEG, Twig, Burg and Iburg. The tree
  matcher generated by NONA uses algorithm similar to one of BEG and
  Iburg, i.e. the algorithm is based on dynamic programming during
  fulfilling code selection.

  Although the algorithm used by BURG and based on dynamic programming
  during tree pattern matcher generation time is considerably more fast,
  it is not acceptable for us. Its main drawback which is to need usage
  of less powerful code selector description results in necessity of
  usage of more machine-dependent low level internal representation.
  For example, the special internal representation node types for
  8-bits, 16-bits constants besides 32-bits constants would be needed.
  Also the algorithm used by BURG is considerably more complex.

  Tree pattern matchers generated by NONA also can work with directed
  acyclic graphs besides trees. This feature is useful when target
  machine instruction is generated from the internal representation
  which is result of some optimizations such as common sub-expression
  elimination.

  2.  Code selector description language

  An code selector description describes mainly tree patterns of low
  level internal representation with associated usage constraints, costs
  and semantic actions. The tree pattern may contains terminal
  representing the low level internal representation node. Nonterminals
  serves to designate the tree patterns. Each terminal or nonterminal
  may have attribute which is evaluated in actions.

  2.1.  Layout of code selector description

  Code selector description structure has the following layout which is
  similar to one of YACC file.


            DECLARATIONS
            %%
            RULES
            %%
            ADDITIONAL C/C++ CODE



  The `%%' serves to separate the sections of description. All sections
  are optional. The first `%%' starts section of rules and is obligatory
  even if the section is empty, the second `%%' may be absent if section
  of additional C/C++ code is absent too.

  The section of declarations contains declarations of terminals by
  names of constants which represent modes of the low level internal
  representation nodes. The section also may contain declarations of
  commutativeness of some terminals. Type and union declarations can be
  used to declare types of terminal and nonterminal attributes. And
  finally the section may contain subsections of code on C/C++.

  The next section contains rules. Each rule describes tree pattern,
  nonterminal designating the pattern, the pattern cost, its usage
  constraint, and associated action. The rule list can be empty. In this
  case the code selector description is used to locate machine dependent
  code and generated code of the tree pattern matcher can not be used.

  The additional C/C++ code can contain any C/C++ code you want to use.
  Often functions which are not generated by the translator but are
  needed to work with code selector description go here. This code
  without changes is placed at the end of file generated by the
  translator.

  2.2.  Declarations

  The section of declarations may contain the following construction:


            %term <TYPE> IDENTIFIER ...



  All terminals must be defined in constructions of such kind (or in
  construction `%commutative'). The same identifier can be defined
  repeatedly. The identifier is a name of constant which represents mode
  of the low level internal representation node. If the user needs usage
  of attributes of different types, the terminal attribute type can be
  given in this construction. The union declaration can be used for
  this.


            %union {
              any thing that can go inside a `union' in C/C++
            }



  The last such construction in the declarations section specifies the
  entire collection of possible types for attribute values. For example:


            %union {
              IR_node_t node;
              int number;
            }



  This means that the two alternative types are `IR_node_t' and `int'.
  They are given by names `node' and `number'. These names are used in
  the type and commutativeness declarations to instruct type of
  attribute for a terminal or nonterminal. The type declarations has the
  following form:


            %type <TYPE> IDENTIFIER ...



  The construction can be used when union declaration is present.  Here
  `TYPE' is a name of type given in union declaration. If the type of
  terminal or nonterminal is not given its type is believed to be
  `CS_TYPE' (see next section). The identifier is one of terminal or
  nonterminal. The construction


            %commutative <TYPE> TERMINAL_IDENTIFIER ...



  describes terminal and commutativeness of operator represented by the
  terminal besides optional instruction for the terminal attribute type.
  For example, if the terminal `plus' is described as commutative then
  pattern `plus (register, constant)' simultaneously designates pattern
  `plus (constant, register)'. There may be also the following construc-
  tions in the declaration section


            %local {
               C/C++ DECLARATIONS
            }

            %import {
               C/C++ DECLARATION
            }

            and

            %export {
               C/C++ DECLARATION
            }



  which contain any C/C++ declarations (types, variables, macros, and so
  on) used in sections. The local C/C++ declarations are inserted at the
  begin of generated implementation file (see code selector description
  interface) but after include-directive of interface file.  C/C++ dec-
  larations which start with `%import' are inserted at the begin of gen-
  erated interface file. For example, such C/C++ code may redefine some
  internal definitions, e.g. macro defining type of attributes. C/C++
  declarations which start with `%export' are inserted at the end of
  generated interface file. For example, such C/C++ code may contain
  definitions of of external variables and functions which refer to def-
  initions generated by NONA. All C/C++ declarations are placed in the
  same order as in the section of declarations.

  2.3.  Rules

  The section of declarations is followed by section of rules . A rule
  is described the following construction


            nonterminal : pattern cost %if constraint action



  The rule connects tree pattern with nonterminal. Several tree patterns
  can be connected to a nonterminal. Nonterminal is given by its identi-
  fier. The rest constructions cost, constraint with keyword `%if', and
  actions are optional. Cost is a integer expression on C/C++ in brack-
  ets `[' and `]'. If the cost is omited in the rule, then its value is
  believed to be zero. The cost value has to be non-negative. Constraint
  which is given as a boolean expression on C/C++ in brackets `[' and
  `]' defines a condition of the tree pattern usage. In the case of
  absent constraint its value is believed to be nonzero. The tree pat-
  tern will be never in a minimal cost cover if constraint value is
  equal to zero during testing the tree pattern as a candidate on inclu-
  sion into minimal cost cover. For example, the following rule with
  constraint describes Am29k instruction CONST


            register : integer_constant [1]
                       %if [IR_value ($1) >=0 && IR_value ($1) < 256]



  The actions can contain any statements on C/C++ in figure brackets `{'
  and `}'. Constructions `$$' and `$n' (n is a integer number here)
  denote attributes of correspondingly nonterminal before `:' and termi-
  nal or nonterminal in the pattern with order number equal to `n'.  The
  order numbers start with 1. These constructions may be present in the
  cost, the constraint and the action. But it should be remembered that
  definition of the moment of the cost and the constraint evaluation is
  quite difficult. Moreover there is not guaranty that given cost and
  constraint will be evaluated. Therefore side effects should be not in
  the cost and in the constraint, and usage attributes of nonterminals
  should be not in the cost and in the constraint. The cost and the con-
  straint may be fulfilled on the first bottom up pass.  It is known
  only that the cost is fulfilled after evaluation of constraint give
  nonzero result. The action of the tree pattern which is a part of
  result minimal cost cover is fulfilled on the second bottom up pass.
  Tree pattern is given by one of the following forms:


            TERMINAL ( PATTERN , ...)
            TERMINAL
            NONTERMINAL



  For example, the following pattern describes Am29050 instruction DMSM


            double_addition (twin, double_multiplication (twin,
                                                          accumulator0))



  It should be remembered that each terminal must have fixed arity in
  all patterns. It means that usage of the following patterns in a code
  selector description will be erroneous.


            integer_addition (register, register)
            integer_addition (register)



  Full YACC syntax of internal representation description language is
  placed in Appendix 1.

  3.  Generated code

  A specification as described in the previous section is translated by
  code selector description translator (NONA) into code selector
  description (CS) interface and implementation files having the same
  names as one of specification file and correspondingly suffixes `.h'
  and `.c' for C or `.cpp' for C++ (see option `-c++').

  3.1.  C Interface objects

  C interface file of CS consists of the following definitions of
  generated type and functions:

  1. There is constant with nonterminal name and prefix `CSNT_' for each
     nonterminal. `CSNT' is abbreviation of code selector description
     nonterminal. The constants are defined as macros (with the aid of C
     preprocessor directive `#define'). The constants are used as
     parameter of functions `CS_it_is_axiom' and `CS_traverse_cover'
     (see below).

  2. Macro `CS_NODE' must represent type of node of low level internal
     representation. This macro can be redefined (only in a C
     declaration section which starts with `%import'). By default this
     macro is defined as follows:


                  #define CS_NODE           struct IR_node_struct *



  3. Macro `CS_TYPE' defines type of terminal and nonterminal
     attributes. This macro can not be redefined if the corresponding
     code selector description has a construction `%union' which already
     describes terminal and nonterminal attribute types because in this
     case the default macro definition is absent. By default this macro
     is defined as follows:


                  #define CS_TYPE           CS_node



  4. Type `CS_node' is defined as follows:


                  typedef CS_NODE CS_node;



  5. Type `CS_cover' describes a minimal cost cover. The values of this
     types are created by function `CS_find_cover' and deleted by
     function `CS_delete_cover'.

  6. Function


               `CS_cover CS_find_cover (CS_node node)'



  makes the first bottom up pass on directed acyclic graph given by its
  node and finds a minimal cost cover for each nonterminal. The minimal
  cost cover is returned. If error occurs during the pass then macro
  `CS_ERROR' (see below) is evaluated. For example, the cause of error
  may be meeting undeclared terminal code. During building cover, each
  directed acyclic graph (DAG) node is visited only once.

  7. Function


               `int CS_it_is_axiom (CS_cover cover, int nonterminal)'



  returns 1 if there is a minimal cost cover for given nonterminal in
  given cover, 0 otherwise.

  8. Function


               `CS_TYPE CS_traverse_cover (CS_cover cover, int nonterminal)'



  makes the second bottom up, left to right pass and fulfills actions
  corresponding a minimal cost cover for given nonterminal in cover
  found by call of function `CS_find_cover'. A minimal cost cover for
  given nonterminal must be in given cover before the function call.
  This condition can be checked by function `CS_it_is_axiom'. The func-
  tion returns attribute of given nonterminal after fulfilling the
  actions. Remember that action (and attribute evaluation) associated
  with tree pattern is fulfilled only once for each occurrence of the
  tree pattern in given cover of a directed acyclic graph.

  9. Function


               `void CS_delete_cover (CS_cover cover)'



  frees memory allocated to `cover' which was to be created by call of
  function `CS_find_cover'. Of course this cover can not be used in
  function `CS_traverse_cover' after that. The memory is freed in the
  reverse order therefore allocation macros (see below) can use stack
  strategy of the memory allocation.

  10.
     Function


               `void CS_start (void)'



  is to be called before any work with code selector description. The
  function initiates code selector description storage management (see
  below).

  11.
     Function


               `void CS_finish (void)'



  is to be last. The function finishes code selector description storage
  management. Therefore only function `CS_start' can be called after
  this function call.

  3.2.  C++ Interface objects

  C++ interface file (see option -c++) of CS consists of the following
  definitions of generated type and functions:

  1. There is constant with nonterminal name and prefix `CSNT_' for each
     nonterminal. `CSNT' is abbreviation of code selector description
     nonterminal. The constants are defined as macros (with the aid of C
     preprocessor directive `#define'). The constants are used as
     parameter of functions `CS_it_is_axiom' and `CS_traverse_cover'
     (see below).

  2. Macro `CS_NODE' must represent type of node of low level internal
     representation. This macro can be redefined (only in a C
     declaration section which starts with `%import'). By default this
     macro is defined as follows:


                  #define CS_NODE           struct IR_node_struct *



  3. Macro `CS_TYPE' defines type of terminal and nonterminal
     attributes. This macro can not be redefined if the corresponding
     code selector description has a construction `%union' which already
     describes terminal and nonterminal attribute types because in this
     case the default macro definition is absent. By default this macro
     is defined as follows:


                  #define CS_TYPE           CS_node



  4. Type `CS_node' is defined as follows:


                  typedef CS_NODE CS_node;



  5. Type `CS_cover' describes a minimal cost cover. It is pointer
     objects of a class. The class has not public constructors and
     desctructors. The class objects can be created only by function
     `CS_find_cover' and can be deleted by function `CS_traverse_cover'.
     This class has the following friend functions:

     a. Function


                      `CS_cover CS_find_cover (CS_node node)'



     makes the first bottom up pass on directed acyclic graph given by
     its node and finds a minimal cost cover for each nonterminal. The
     minimal cost cover is returned. If error occurs during the pass
     then macro `CS_ERROR' (see below) is evaluated. For example, the
     cause of error may be meeting undeclared terminal code. During
     building cover, each directed acyclic graph (DAG) node is visited
     only once.


     b. Function


                      `void CS_start (void)'



     is to be called before any work with code selector description. The
     function initiates code selector description storage management
     (see below).


     c. Function


                      `void CS_finish (void)'



     is to be last. The function finishes code selector description
     storage management. Therefore only function `CS_start' can be
     called after this function call.


     This class has also the following class functions:

     a. Function


                      `int CS_it_is_axiom (int nonterminal)'



     returns 1 if there is a minimal cost cover for given nonterminal in
     given cover, 0 otherwise.


     b. Function


                      `CS_TYPE CS_traverse_cover (int nonterminal)'



     makes the second bottom up, left to right pass and fulfills actions
     corresponding a minimal cost cover for given nonterminal in cover
     found by call of function `CS_find_cover'. A minimal cost cover for
     given nonterminal must be in given cover before the function call.
     This condition can be checked by function `CS_it_is_axiom'. The
     function returns attribute of given nonterminal after fulfilling
     the actions. Remember that action (and attribute evaluation) asso-
     ciated with tree pattern is fulfilled only once for each occurrence
     of the tree pattern in given cover of a directed acyclic graph.


     c. Function


                      `void CS_delete_cover (void)'



     frees memory allocated to the cover which was to be created by call
     of function `CS_find_cover'. Of course the function `CS_tra-
     verse_cover' can not be used after that (because the object is
     removed). The memory is freed in the reverse order therefore allo-
     cation macros (see below) can use stack strategy of the memory
     allocation.

  3.3.  Implementation file macros

  CS implementation file uses the following macros generated by NONA.
  These macros can be redefined (in any C/C++ declaration section).

  1. Macro `CS_OPERATION(node)' must return value defined by a constant
     which represents mode of the low level internal representation node
     (see description of construction `%term').

  2. Macros


               `CS_OPERAND_1_OF_1(node)',
               `CS_OPERAND_1_OF_2(node)',
               `CS_OPERAND_2_OF_2(node)', and so on.



  These macros define the structure of the low level internal represen-
  tation for which is needed to build minimal cost cover. The structure
  must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

  Macro of kind `CS_OPERAND_k_OF_n' defines k-th arc from the DAG node
  given as the macro argument which has `n' such arcs.  Let us consider
  tree pattern


               `integer_plus (register, const8)'



  To access to children of node represented by terminal `integer_plus'
  the macros `CS_OPERAND_1_OF_2' and `CS_OPERAND_2_OF_2' will be used.

  3. Macros


               `CS_STATE(node)',
               `CS_SET_STATE(node, state)'



  define access to the a DAG node field. The field is used by tree pat-
  tern matchers. The type of this field must be any pointer type. Macro
  `CS_STATE' has one argument of type `CS_node'. Macro `CS_SET_STATE'
  has two arguments of types correspondingly `CS_node' and `void *'.

  4. Macro `CS_ATTRIBUTE(node)' must return value of type `CS_TYPE'.
     This value is attribute of the terminal corresponding to given node
     of low level internal representation.

     This macro for given terminal may be evaluated several times
     because the terminal attribute can be in cost or constraint
     constructions. The value of the macro for the terminal must be l-
     value (variable in other words) when construction `%union' is
     present and given terminal is declared with type because in this
     case the operation `.' of C/C++ language is applyed to the macro
     value in order to get access to the terminal attribute.

  5. Macro `CS_ERROR(str)' is a reaction on fixing an error by tree
     pattern matcher. The macro argument is tree pattern matcher message
     about the error.

     By default these macros are defined as follows:


           #define CS_OPERATION(node)        IR_NODE_MODE (node)
           #define CS_OPERAND_1_OF_1(node)   IR_operand (node)
           #define CS_OPERAND_1_OF_2(node)   IR_operand_1 (node)
           #define CS_OPERAND_2_OF_2(node)   IR_operand_2 (node)
           #define CS_OPERAND_1_OF_3(node)   IR_operand_1 (node)
           #define CS_OPERAND_2_OF_3(node)   IR_operand_2 (node)
           #define CS_OPERAND_3_OF_3(node)   IR_operand_3 (node)
           ...
           #define CS_STATE(node)            IR_state (node)
           #define CS_SET_STATE(node, state) IR_set_state (node, state)
           #define CS_ATTRIBUTE(node)        (node)
           #define CS_ERROR(str)             fprintf (stderr, "%s\012", str)



  3.4.  Storage management macros

  NONA completely automatically generates macros of storage management
  for the cover. Usually, the user does not have to care about it. The
  predefined storage management uses C standard functions for global
  storage with free lists. The user can create own storage manager by
  redefinition of one or more the following macros and placing them in a
  C declaration section. But the user should know that all functions
  generated by NONA believe that the storage can not change its place
  after the allocation.

  1. Macros `CS_START_ALLOC()', `CS_FINISH_ALLOC()' are evaluated in
     functions correspondingly `CS_start' and `CS_finish' and are to be
     used to start and finish work with the storage manager.

  2. Macros `CS_ALLOC(ptr, size, ptr_type)', `CS_FREE(ptr, size)'
     allocate and free storage whose size is given as the second
     parameter. The first parameter serves to return pointer to memory
     being allocated or to point to memory being freed.

     By default these macros are defined as follows:


           #define CS_START_ALLOC()
           #define CS_FINISH_ALLOC()
           #define CS_ALLOC(ptr, size, ptr_type) \
                                  ((ptr) = (ptr_type) malloc (size))
           #define CS_FREE(ptr, size)  free (ptr)



  4.  NONA Usage



       NONA(1)                          User Manuals                          NONA(1)



       NAME
              nona - code selector description translator

       SYNOPSIS
              nona [ -c++ -v -debug -export -pprefix] specification-file


       DESCRIPTION
              Command  nona  translates  code  selector  description  (CS)  which  is
              described in specification file into code for  solving  code  selection
              (tree  matcher)  and  possibly other back-end tasks.  The specification
              file must have suffix `.nona'.
                Tree matcher determined by CS builds cover of low level internal rep
              resentation  (which  must be a directed acyclic graph) by the tree pat
              terns with minimal cost on  the  first  bottom  up  pass  and  fulfills
              actions  associated with the choiced tree patterns on the second bottom
              up pass.


              Generated code consists of interface and  implementation  files  having
              the  same  names  as one of specification file and correspondingly suf
              fixes `.h' and `.c' (C code) or `.cpp' (C++ code).

              Full documentation of OKA is in OKA User's manual.

       OPTIONS
              The options which are known for NONA are:

              -c++   NONA generates C++ code instead of C code (default).

              -v     NONA outputs statistic information to standard output stream.

              -debug NONA outputs debugging information during execution of  function
                     `CS_find_cover' and `CS_traverse_cover' (see generated code).

              -export
                     NONA generates macros defining identifiers of terminals as inte
                     ger constants and inclusion of  their  in  the  interface  file.
                     Usually  the user himself declares the identifiers in a C decla
                     rations section.
