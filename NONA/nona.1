.SH NAME
nona \- code selector description translator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nona [ -c++ -v -debug -export -pprefix]
.I specification-file

.SH DESCRIPTION

Command
.B nona
translates code selector description (CS) which is
described in specification file into code for solving code
selection (tree matcher) and possibly other back-end tasks.  The
specification file must have suffix
.B `.nona'.
  Tree matcher determined by CS builds cover of low level internal
representation (which must be a directed acyclic graph) by the tree
patterns with minimal cost on the first bottom up pass and fulfills
actions associated with the choiced tree patterns on the second bottom
up pass.

.PP
Generated code consists of interface and implementation files
having the same names as one of specification file and
correspondingly suffixes
.B `.h'
and
.B `.c'
(C code) or
.B `.cpp'
(C++ code).
.PP
Full documentation of OKA is in OKA User's manual.
.SH OPTIONS
The options which are known for NONA are:
.IP -c++
NONA generates C++ code instead of C code (default).
.IP -v
NONA outputs statistic information to standard output stream.
.IP -debug
NONA outputs debugging information during execution of
function `CS_find_cover' and `CS_traverse_cover' (see
generated code).
.IP -export
NONA generates macros defining identifiers of terminals as
integer constants and inclusion of their in the interface
file.  Usually the user himself declares the identifiers in
a C declarations section.
.IP -pprefix
NONA generates names starting with prefix `prefix' instead of
`CS'.
