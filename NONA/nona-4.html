NAME
       nona - code selector description translator

SYNOPSIS
       nona [ -c++ -v -debug -export -pprefix] specification-file


DESCRIPTION
       Command  nona  translates  code  selector  description  (CS)  which  is
       described in specification file into code for  solving  code  selection
       (tree  matcher)  and  possibly other back-end tasks.  The specification
       file must have suffix `.nona'.
         Tree matcher determined by CS builds cover of low level internal rep‐
       resentation  (which  must be a directed acyclic graph) by the tree pat‐
       terns with minimal cost on  the  first  bottom  up  pass  and  fulfills
       actions  associated with the choiced tree patterns on the second bottom
       up pass.


       Generated code consists of interface and  implementation  files  having
       the  same  names  as one of specification file and correspondingly suf‐
       fixes `.h' and `.c' (C code) or `.cpp' (C++ code).

       Full documentation of OKA is in OKA User's manual.

OPTIONS
       The options which are known for NONA are:

       -c++   NONA generates C++ code instead of C code (default).

       -v     NONA outputs statistic information to standard output stream.

       -debug NONA outputs debugging information during execution of  function
              `CS_find_cover' and `CS_traverse_cover' (see generated code).

       -export
              NONA generates macros defining identifiers of terminals as inte‐
              ger constants and inclusion of  their  in  the  interface  file.
              Usually  the user himself declares the identifiers in a C decla‐
              rations section.

       -pprefix
              NONA generates names starting with prefix  `prefix'  instead  of
              `CS'.

FILES
       file.nona
              NONA specification file
       file.c
              generated C implementation file
       file.cpp
              generated C++ implementation file
       file.h
              generated interface file

       There are no any temporary files used by NONA.

ENVIRONMENT
       There are no environment variables which affect NONA behavior.

DIAGNOSTICS
       NONA diagnostics is self-explanatory.
