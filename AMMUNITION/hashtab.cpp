   TITLE:       Package for work with hash tables

   DESCRIPTION: This package implements features analogous to ones of
       public domain functions `hsearch', `hcreate' and `hdestroy'.
       The goal of the package creation is to implement additional
       needed features.  The abstract data permits to work
       simultaneously with several expandable hash tables.  Besides
       insertion and search of elements the elements from the hash
       tables can be also removed.  The table element can be only a
       pointer.  The size of hash tables is not fixed.  The hash table
       will be expanded when its occupancy will became big.  The
       abstract data implementation is based on generalized Algorithm
       D from Knuth's book "The art of computer programming".  Hash
       table is expanded by creation of new hash table and
       transferring elements from the old table to the new table.

   SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:
         Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g. by option `-D' in C++ compiler
       command line) during the file compilation disables to fix
       some internal errors and errors of usage of the package.
