  This directory AMMUNITION contains reusable packages on C/C++:
`allocate', `vlobject', `objstack', `hashtab', `commline', `ticker',
`position', `errors', `bits', `arithm', `IEEE':
   o allocate
        Allocating and freeing memory with automatic fixing some
        allocation errors.
   o vlobject
        Work with variable length objects (VLO).  Any number of bytes
        may be added to and removed from the end of VLO.  If it is
        needed the memory allocated for storing variable length object
        may be expanded possibly with changing the object place.  But
        between any additions of the bytes (or tailoring) the object
        place is not changed.  To decrease number of changes of the
        object place the memory being allocated for the object is
        longer than the current object length.
   o objstack
        Work with stacks of objects (OS).  Work with the object on the
        stack top is analogous to one with a variable length object.
        One motivation for the package is the problem of growing char
        strings in symbol tables.  Memory for OS is allocated by
        segments.  A segment may contain more one objects.  The most
        recently allocated segment contains object on the top of OS.
        If there is not sufficient free memory for the top object than
        new segment is created and the top object is transferred into
        the new segment, i.e. there is not any memory reallocation.
        Therefore the top object may change its address. But other
        objects never change address.
   o hashtab
        Work with hash tables.  The package permits to work
        simultaneously with several expandable hash tables.  Besides
        insertion and search of elements the elements from the hash
        tables can be also removed.  The table element can be only a
        pointer.  The size of hash tables is not fixed.  The hash
        table will be automatically expanded when its occupancy will
        became big.
   o position
        Work with source code positions.  The package serves to
        support information about source positions of compiled files
        taking all included files into account.
   o errors
        Output of compiler messages.  The package serves output
        one-pass or multi-pass compiler messages of various modes
        (errors, warnings, fatal, system errors and appended messages)
        in Unix style or for traditional listing.  The package also
        permits adequate error reporting for included files.
   o commline
        Work with command line.  The package implements features
        analogous to ones of public domain function `getopt'.  The
        goal of the package creation is to use more readable language
        of command line description and to use command line
        description as help output of program.
   o ticker
        Simultaneous work with several tickers (timers).
   o bits
        Work with bit strings (copying, moving, setting, testing,
        comparison).
   o arithm
        Implementing host machine-independently arbitrary precision
        integer numbers arithmetic.  The implementation of the package
        functions are not sufficiently efficient in order to use for
        run-time.  The package functions are oriented to implement
        constant-folding in compilers, cross-compilers.
   o IEEE
        Implementing host machine-independently IEEE floating point
        arithmetic.  The implementation of the package functions are
        not sufficiently efficient in order to use for run-time.  The
        package functions are oriented to implement constant-folding
        in compilers, cross-compilers.

  There are files with corresponding names and extensions `.h'
(interface file for C/C++), `.c' (implementation file on C), and
`.cpp' (implementation file on C++).

  To install AMMUNITION see file INSTALL in the current directory.

  There are also shell scripts for testing the package with
corresponding names and extension `.tst'.  Documentation of the
reusable packages is in files `ammunition.txt', `ammunition.dvi',
`ammunition.ps', `ammunition.info*', `ammunition*.html',
`ammunition*.rtf' for C and `ammunition++.txt', `ammunition++.dvi',
`ammunition++.ps', `ammunition++.info*', `ammunition++*.html',
`ammunition++*.rtf'.
