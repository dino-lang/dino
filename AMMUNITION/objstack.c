   TITLE:       Package for work with stacks of objects (OS)

   DESCRIPTION:
       This file implements internal functions of the package.

   SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:
       The following functions are to be used only by the package
       macros.  Remember that they are internal functions - all work
       with OS is executed through the macros.
         Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g. by option `-D' in C compiler
       command line) during the file compilation disables to fix
       some internal errors and errors of usage of the package.
