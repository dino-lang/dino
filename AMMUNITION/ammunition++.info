2 Package for allocating memory with fixing some allocation errors
******************************************************************

Developing modern compilers it is necessary to avoid arbitrary limits on
the length or number of any data structure by allocating all data
structures dynamically.  Here the package 'allocate' which implements
allocation and freeing memory with automatic fixing allocation errors is
suggested.

   The package automatically calls action on situation 'no memory'.  The
action never returns control back because after calling function which
processes allocation error the function 'abort' is always called.
Therefore the function which processes allocation error should not
return control back.

   The interface part of the package is file 'allocate.h'.  The
implementation part is file 'allocate.cpp'.  The interface contains
class 'allocate' without any public constructors/destructors.  The class
has the following functions:

'Static public function `change_error_function''

                  `void change_error_function
                        (void (*error_function) (void))) (void)'


     is used for changing up action on the situation 'no memory'.  The
     function also returns former function which was early action on the
     situation 'no memory'.

'Static public function `default_error_function''

                  `void default_error_function (void)'


     is default action of the package on the situation 'no memory'.
     This action consists of output message '*** no memory ***' to
     standard error stream and calling function 'exit' with code equals
     to 1.

'Static public function `malloc''

                  `void *malloc (size_t size)'


     is analogous to ANSI C library function 'malloc'.  The parameter is
     size of needed memory.  The function returns address of allocated
     memory.

'Static public function `calloc''

                  `void *calloc (size_t nel, size_t size)'


     is analogous to ANSI C library function 'calloc'.  The parameters
     have the same sense as in standard function 'calloc'.  The function
     returns address of allocated memory.

'Static public function `free''

                  `void free (void *ptr)'


     is analogous to ANSI C library function 'free' but can accept nil
     pointer value.  In this case function does nothing.

'Static public function `realloc''

                  `void *realloc(void *old, size_t size)'


     is analogous to ANSI C library function 'realloc'.  The first
     parameter is old address of reallocated memory.  The second
     parameter is new size of reallocated memory.  The function returns
     new address of reallocated memory.

3 Package for work with variable length objects
***********************************************

The package 'vlobject' implements work with variable length object (VLO)
and uses package 'allocate'.  Any number of bytes may be added to and
removed from the end of VLO. If it is needed the memory allocated for
storing variable length object may be expanded possibly with changing
the object place.  But between any additions of the bytes (or tailoring)
the object place is not changed.  To decrease number of changes of the
object place the memory being allocated for the object is longer than
the current object length.

   The package uses package 'allocate'.  The interface part of the
package is file 'vlobject.h'.  Defining macro 'NDEBUG' (e.g.  by option
'-D' in C++ compiler command line) before the inclusion of the interface
file disables fixing some internal errors and errors of usage of the
package.  The implementation part is file 'vlobject.cpp'.  The interface
contains the following objects:

'Type `vlo_t''
     describes a descriptor variable length object.  The type is simply
     synonym of 'class vlo'.  All work with stack of objects is executed
     through the descriptors.  It should remember that work with the
     object through several descriptors is not safe.

'Macro `VLO_DEFAULT_LENGTH''
     has value which is default initial size of memory is allocated for
     VLO when the object is created (with not given initial size).
     Original value of the macros is equal to 512.  This macro can be
     redefined in C++ compiler command line or with the aid of directive
     '#undef' before including the interface file.

'Class `vlo''
     The class contains the following functions:

     'Public constructor `vlo''

                            `vlo (size_t initial_length = VLO_DEFAULT_LENGTH)'


          is used for creation of descriptor of VLO with initial zero
          length.  If the parameter value is absent, the value is equal
          to zero then the VLO initial allocated memory length is equal
          to 'VLO_DEFAULT_LENGTH'.

     'Public destructor ` vlo''

                            `~vlo (void)'


          is used for deleting the descritor of VLO and freeing memory
          used by the VLO.

     'Public function `nullify''

                            `void nullify (void)'


          makes that length of VLO of given descriptor will be equal to
          zero (but memory for VLO is not freed and not reallocated).

     'Public function `tailor''

                            `void tailor (void)'


          makes that length of memory allocated for VLO of given
          descriptor becomes equal to VLO length.

     'Public function `length''

                            `size_t length (void)'


          returns current length of VLO of given descriptor.

     'Public functions `begin', `end', `bound''

                            `void *begin(void)', `void *end(void)', `void *bound(void)'


          return pointer (of type 'void *') to correspondingly the
          first, the last byte of VLO of given descriptor, and pointer
          to the last byte plus one.  Remember that the object may
          change own place after any addition.

     'Public function `shorten''

                            `void shorten (size_t n)'


          removes n bytes from the end of VLO of given descriptor.  VLO
          is nullified if its length is less than n.

     'Public function `expand''

                            `void expand (size_t length)'


          increases length of VLO of given descriptor on number of bytes
          given as the parameter.  The values of bytes added to the end
          of VLO will be not defined.

     'Public function `add_byte''

                            `void add_byte (int b)'


          adds byte given as the parameter to the end of VLO of given
          descriptor.

     'Public function `add_memory''

                            `void add_memory (void *str, size_t length)'


          adds memory starting with address given as the first macro
          parameter and with length given as the second parameter to the
          end of VLO of given descriptor.

     'Public function `add_string''

                            `void add_string (const char *str)'


          adds C string (with end marker 0) given as the parameter to
          the end of VLO of given descriptor.  Before the addition the
          macro deletes last character of the VLO. The last character is
          suggested to be C string end marker 0.

4 Package for work with stacks of objects
*****************************************

The package 'objstack' is based on package 'allocate' and implements
efficient work with stacks of objects (OS). Work with the object on the
stack top is analogous to one with a variable length object.  One
motivation for the package is the problem of growing char strings in
symbol tables.  Memory for OS is allocated by segments.  A segment may
contain more one objects.  The most recently allocated segment contains
object on the top of OS. If there is not sufficient free memory for the
top object than new segment is created and the top object is transferred
into the new segment, i.e.  there is not any memory reallocation.
Therefore the top object may change its address.  But other objects
never change address.

   The package uses package 'allocate'.  The interface part of the
package is file 'objstack.h'.  Defining macro 'NDEBUG' (e.g.  by option
'-D' in C++ compiler command line) before inclusion of the interface
file disables fixing some internal errors and errors of usage of the
package.  The implementation part is file 'objstack.cpp'.  The interface
contains the following objects:

'Type `os_t''
     describes a descriptor of stack of objects.  The type is simply
     synonym of 'class os'.  All work with stack of objects is executed
     through the descriptors.  It should remember that work with the
     stack through several descriptors is not safe.

'Macro `OS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH''
     has value which is default size of memory segments which will be
     allocated for OS when the stack is created (with not given initial
     segment size).  This is also minimal size of all segments.
     Original value of the macros is equal to 512.  This macro can be
     redefined in C++ compiler command line or with the aid of directive
     '#undef' before including the interface file.

'Class `os''
     The class contains the following functions:

     'Public constructor `os''

                          `os (size_t initial_segment_length
                                           = OS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH)'


          creates OS which contains the single zero length object.
          Minimum size of memory segments which will be allocated for OS
          is given as the parameter.  If the parameter is absent the
          allocated memory segments length is equal to
          'OS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH'. But in any case the segment
          length is always not less than maximum alignment.

     'Public destructor ` os''

                          `~os (void)'


          is used for deleting the descritor of OS and freeing memory
          used by the OS.

     'Public function `empty''

                          `void empty (void)'


          is used for removing all objects on OS and freeing all memory
          allocated for OS except for the first segment.

     'Public function `top_finish''

                          `void top_finish (void)'


          creates new variable length object with initial zero length on
          the top of OS of given descriptor.  The work (analogous to one
          with variable length object) with object which was on the top
          of OS is finished, i.e.  the object will never more change
          address.

     'Public function `top_nullify''

                          `void top_nullify (void)'


          makes that length of variable length object on the top of OS
          of given descriptor will be equal to zero.

     'Public function `top_length''

                          `size_t top_length (os)'


          returns current length of variable length object on the top of
          OS of given descriptor.

     'Public functions `top_begin', `top_end', `top_bound''

                          `void *top_begin (void)', `void *top_end (void)',
                          `void *top_bound (void)'


          return pointer to correspondingly the first, the last byte of
          variable length object on the top of OS of given descriptor,
          and pointer to the last byte plus one.  Remember that the top
          object may change own place after any addition.

     'Public function `top_shorten''

                          `void top_shorten (size_t n)'


          removes n bytes from the end of variable length object on the
          top of OS of given descriptor.  The top variable length object
          is nullified if its length is less than n.

     'Public function `top_expand''

                          `void top_expand (size_t length)'


          increases length of variable length object on the top of OS of
          given descriptor on number of bytes given as the parameter.
          The values of bytes added to the end of variable length object
          on the top of OS will be not defined.

     'Public function `top_add_byte''

                          `void top_add_byte (int b)'


          adds byte given as the parameter to the end of variable length
          object on the top of OS of given descriptor.

     'Public function `top_add_memory''

                          `void top_add_memory (void *str, size_t length)'


          adds memory starting with address given as the first parameter
          and with length given as the second parameter to the end of
          variable length object on the top of OS of given descriptor.

     'Public function `top_add_string''

                          `void top_add_string (const char *str)'


          adds C++ string (with end marker 0) given as the parameter to
          the end of variable length string on the top of OS of the
          descriptor.  Before the addition the macro deletes last
          character of the top variable length object.  The last
          character is suggested to be C++ string end marker 0.

5 Package for work with hash tables
***********************************

The most compilers use search structures.  Here the package 'hashtab'
which implements expandable hash tables is suggested.  This abstract
data implements features analogous to ones of public domain functions
'hsearch', 'hcreate' and 'hdestroy'.  The goal of the abstract data
creation is to implement additional needed features.  The abstract data
permits to work simultaneously with several expandable hash tables.
Besides insertion and search of elements the elements from the hash
tables can be also removed.  The table element can be only a pointer.
The size of hash tables is not fixed.  The hash table will be expanded
when its occupancy will become big.

   The abstract data implementation is based on generalized Algorithm D
from Knuth's book "The art of computer programming".  Hash table is
expanded by creation of new hash table and transferring elements from
the old table to the new table.

   The package uses package 'allocate'.  The interface part of the
abstract data is file 'hashtab.h'.  The implementation part is file
'hashtab.cpp'.  The interface contains the following objects:

'Type `hash_table_entry_t''
     is described as 'void *' and represents hash table element type.
     Empty entries have value 'NULL'.

'Type `hash_table_t''
     describes hash table itself.  The type is simply synonym of 'class
     hash_table *'.

'Class `hash_table''
     The class contains the following functions:

     'Public constructor `hash_table''

                          `hash_table
                             (size_t size,
                              unsigned (*hash_function)
                                                 (hash_table_entry_t el_ptr),
                              int (*eq_function) (hash_table_entry_t el1_ptr,
                                                  hash_table_entry_t el2_ptr))'


          creates hash table with length slightly longer than value of
          function parameter 'size'.  Created hash table is initiated as
          empty (all the hash table entries are NULL). The hash table
          will use functions 'hash_function', 'eq_function' given as the
          function parameters to evaluate table element hash value and
          function to test on equality of two table elements.

     'Public destructor ` hash_table''

                          `~hash_table (void)'


          deletes given hash table and frees memory allocated for it.

     'Public function `empty''

                          `void empty  (void)'


          makes the hash table empty.  If you need to remove all table
          elements, it is better to use this function than several times
          function 'remove_element_from_entry'.  This function does not
          change size of the table or clear statistics about collisions.

     'Public function `find_entry''

                          `hash_table_entry_t *find_entry
                                               (hash_table_entry_t element,
                                                int reserve)'


          searches for hash table entry which contains element equal to
          value of the function parameter 'element' or empty entry in
          which 'element' can be placed (if the element does not exist
          in the table).  The function parameter 'reserve' is to be
          nonzero if the element is to be placed in the table.  The
          element should be inserted into the table entry before another
          call of 'find_hash_table_entry'.  The table is expanded if
          occupancy (taking into account also deleted elements) is more
          than 75%.  The occupancy of the table after the expansion will
          be about 50%.

     'Public function `remove_element_from_entry''

                          `void remove_element_from_entry
                                   (hash_table_entry_t element)'


          removes element from hash table_entry whose value is given as
          the function parameter.  Hash table entry for given value
          should be not empty (or deleted).  The hash table entry value
          will be marked as deleted after the function call.

     'Public function `size''

                          `size_t size (void)'


          returns current size of given hash table.

     'Public function `elements_number''

                          `size_t elements_number (void)'


          returns current number of elements in given hash table.

     'Public function `collisions''

                          `int collisions (void)'


          returns number of of percents of fixed collisions during all
          work with given hash table.

     'Static public function `all_collisions''

                          `int all_collisions (void)'


          returns number of of percents of fixed collisions during all
          work with all hash tables.

6 Package for work with source code positions
*********************************************

The compilers often use internal representation which stores source code
positions.  Here package 'position' which serves to support information
about source positions of compiled files taking into account all
included files is suggested.

   The strategy of the package usage can be follows.  Function
'initiate' of class 'positions' is called by the first.  After that
function 'start_file' of class 'positions' is called when a file is
opened for compilation as source or included file.  Members
'line_number' and 'column_number' of variable 'current_position' are
modified correspondingly during given file compilation.  The value of
'current_position' can be stored into internal representation for usage
for output messages on the following passes.  Function 'finish_file' of
class 'positions' is called when a processed file is closed.  Function
'finish' of class 'positions' may be called after all processing a
source file.

   The package uses packages 'vlobject' and 'objstack' which use package
'allocate'.  The interface part of the package is file 'position.h'.
The implementation part is file 'position.cpp'.  The interface contains
the following objects:

'Type `position_t''
     is simply 'class position' describes a file position.  The class
     has the following members:

     'Public members `line_number', `column_number''
          are source line and column corresponding to given position.

     'Public function `file_name''

                              `const char *file_name (void)'


          returns name of file to which given position belongs.

     'Public function `path''

                              `class position *path (void)'


          is pointer to another position class object representing
          position of a include-clause which caused immediately given
          file compilation.

     'Public function `path''

                              `int file_inclusion_level (void)'


          returns number of level of position file inclusion.  The level
          numbers are started with zero for positions corresponding
          non-included files and for positions which does not correspond
          to concrete file.

'Class `positions''
     The class has not public constructors/destructors.  The class has
     the following members:

     'Static const member `no_position''
          has value of type 'position_t' has values 'line_number',
          'column_number' equals to zero or 'NULL'. The value does not
          correspond to concrete file position.

     'Static member `current''
          has value which is current file position.

     'Static public function `initiate''

                          `void initiate (void)'


          initiates the package.  Value of variable 'current' becomes
          equal to 'no_position'.

     'Static public function `finish''

                          `void finish (void)'


          frees all memory allocated during package work.

     'Static public function `start_file''

                          `void start_file (const char *file_name)'


          save position in member variable 'current' and sets up new
          values of members of 'current'.  Values of members
          'file_name', 'line_number', 'column_number', and 'path' become
          equal to the function parameter value, 1, 0, and pointer to
          the saved position.  Values of 'current' during different
          calls of the function must be different (e.g.  different
          columns or lines), i.e.  positions of different
          include-clauses must be different.

     'Static public function `finish_file''

                          `void finish_file (void)'


          restores previous value of the member 'current', more exactly
          sets up the member by position to which the member 'path'
          refers.

     'Static public Function `compare''

                          `int compare_positions (position_t position_1,
                                                  position_t position_2)'


          compares two positions given by parameters of type
          'position_t' and returns -1 (if the first position is less
          than the second), 0 (if the first position is equal to the
          second) or 1 (if the first position is greater than the
          second).  The order of positions is lexicographic.

7 Package for output of compiler messages
*****************************************

The most of compilers report error messages for incorrect program.  Here
the package 'errors' which serves to output one-pass or multi-pass
compiler messages of various modes (errors, warnings, fatal, system
errors and appended messages) in Unix style or for traditional listing
is suggested.  The package also permits adequate error reporting for
included files.

   The package uses packages 'vlobject', 'objstack', 'position' which
use package 'allocate'.  Therefore package 'position' have to be
initiated before any work with this package.  The interface part of the
package is file 'errors.h'.  The implementation part is file
'errors.cpp'.  The maximum length of generated error message is
suggested to be not greater then 'MAX_ERROR_MESSAGE_LENGTH'. The default
value (150) of this macro can be redefined with corresponding C++
compiler option '-DMAX_ERROR_MESSAGE_LENGTH=...'  during compilation of
file 'errors.cpp'.  The interface contains only one class 'errors'.  The
class has the following members:

'Public functions `number_of_errors', `number_of_warnings''

                  `unsigned int number_of_errors (void)'
                  `unsigned int number_of_warnings (void)'


     return values which are number of correspondingly errors and
     warnings fixed after given class object creation.

'Integer variable `maximum_number_of_errors''
     has value which is maximum number of errors which will be fixed.
     If an error is fixed with number equals to
     'maximum_number_of_errors' then special fatal error 'fatal error -
     too many errors' with position of given error is fixed instead of
     the error.  And all following errors are ignored.  Zero value of
     the variable means that the special fatal error will never fixed.

'Public virtual function `fatal_error_function''

                  `void fatal_error_function (void)'


     without parameters which will be called after fixing a fatal error.
     The fatal error function is suggested to do not return the control
     back.  The default fatal error function only calls 'exit (1)'.

'Public constructor `errors''

                  `errors (int immediate_output_flag)'


     creates the class 'errors' object working in regime depending on
     parameter value.  If the parameter value is nonzero than all fixed
     messages are output immediately.  Otherwise the compiler messages
     are stored until function 'output' are called.

'Public destructor ` errors''

                  `~errors (void)'


     frees all memory allocated during the class 'errors' object work.

'Public function `output''

                  `void output (void)'


     sorts (stable sorting) all fixed messages by their positions,
     outputs ones, and deletes ones.  Appended messages will be output
     after corresponding error or warning.  This function should be used
     only in regime of storing messages.

'Public function `error''


                       `void error (int fatal_error_flag, position_t
                                    position, const char *format, ...)'


     fixes error (fatal error if the first parameter value is nonzero)
     at the position given as the second parameter.  If the error is
     fatal than functions 'output' and '*fatal_error_function' are
     called.  The diagnostic messages are formed analogous to output of
     function 'printf'.  For example,

                     error (1, current_position, "fatal error - no memory");


'Public function `warning''

                  `void warning (position_t position, const char *format, ...)'


     is analogous to the previous but is used to fix a warning.

'Public function `append_message''

                  `void append_message (position_t position,
                                        const char *format, ...)'


     When regime of immediately output of fixed message is on this
     function is analogous to the previous (except for incrementing
     'number_of_warnings').  In opposite case the appended message will
     be output with the most recent fixed error or warning independently
     from value of the first parameter.  Of course the previously fixed
     error or warning must exist.

     For example, this function may be used for generation of messages
     of type

                        `<file>:<line>:<position-1>: repeated declaration'


     and then

                        `<file>:<line>:<position-1>: previous declaration'.


     Description of function 'output_error_function' contains
     explanation why decremented position is output.

'Public function `system_error''

                  `void system_error (int fatal_error_flag,
                                      position_t position,
                                      const char *format, ...)'


     is analogous to function 'error' but serves to fix a system error.
     The current system message without head blanks (given by standard
     function 'strerror') is placed after the message formed by the
     function parameters.  For example, the following call may be used
     when a file is not opened

                       system_error  (1, current_position,
                                      "fatal error - %s:", new_file_name);


'Public virtual function `output_error_function''

                  `void default_output_error_function
                        (int appended_message_flag, position_t position,
                         const char *message)'


     is used to output error message.  The function has three parameters
     - flag of appended message, message position and message itself.

     By default the function is oriented to output in Unix style
     according to GNU standard.  To output a listing the function
     'output_error_function' should be changed.  The default function
     output message in the following formats:

            MESSAGE                              (NULL file name)
            FILE_NAME:1: MESSAGE                 (zero line number)
            FILE_NAME:LINE_NUMBER: MESSAGE       (zero column number)
            FILE_NAME:LINE_NUMBER:COLUMN_NUMBER: MESSAGE  (all other cases)


     After that the function outputs newline.  The function also outputs
     additional messages 'in file processed from ...'  if given message
     is not appended message and corresponds to file different from one
     of previous output error.  This message reflects path of the
     message position (see package 'position'), i.e.  reflects positions
     of corresponding include-clauses.

8 Package for work with command line
************************************

To make easy process of command line, here abstract data 'commline' is
suggested.  This abstract data implements features analogous to ones of
public domain function 'getopt'.  The goal of the abstract data creation
is to use more readable language of command line description and to use
command line description as help output of program.

   POSIX terminology concerning command line is used here.  Command line
is divided into command name and arguments.  The arguments are
subdivided into options, option-arguments and operands.  Option starts
with '-'.  All arguments after first '-' in command line are treated as
operands.

   The description of command line is made up from two parts.  Any part
(or both) may be absent in the description.  First part contains
option-arguments names of options which are in the second part.
option-arguments names are separated by white space.  The second part
starts with percents '%%' and contains any text in which description of
options are placed.  Any description of option starts with character "'
followed by character '-' and finishes by character '".  White spaces
may precede option-argument name.  It means that the corresponding
option has obligatory separate option-argument.  For example, the
following may be a part of description of options of a pascal compiler
command line.

     dir xxx file
     %%
     command line:  pc [options] file ...
                                    Options:
     `-0'      Pascal standard level 0    `-1'      Pascal standard Level 1.
     `-29000'  Am29000 code generation    `-29050'* Am29050 code generation
     `-c'      only object files creation `-el'     output of listing
     `-g'      information for debuggers  `-Idir'   data task units directory
     `-lxxx'   library                    `-Ldir'   libraries directory
     `-o file' output file                `-O'      all optimizations
     `-S'      only ass. code creation    `-v'      loaded processes indication
     `-w'      no warnings generation
                    Star * marks defaults

   In this example options with names '-I', '-l', '-L' and '-o' have
option-arguments but only option with name '-o' has separate
option-argument, i.e.  option-argument which is represented by separate
argument after given option in command line.

   The interface part of the abstract data is file 'commline.h'.  The
package uses package 'vlobject' which use package 'allocate'.  The
implementation part is file 'commline.cpp'.  The interface contains only
one class 'command_line'.  The class has the following members:

'Public constructor `command_line''

                    `command_line (int argc, char **argv,
                                   const char *description,
                                   int &correct_description_flag)'


     The constructor processes command line description given as string
     parameter and command line itself given as two parameter 'argc' and
     'argv'.  The function returns 0 through parameter
     'correct_description_flag' if error in command line description is
     fixed, otherwise returns 1 (it means success).

'Public destructor `command_line''

                    `~command_line (void)'


     finishes work with the command line.

'Public function `output_description''

                    `void output_description (void)'


     outputs the second part (without '%%') of description of options to
     stderr.  This function should be called when it is necessary to
     show the program usage.

'Public function `next_operand''

                    `int next_operand (int flag_of_first)'


     returns command line argument number of next operand if the
     function parameter is nonzero.  Otherwise the function returns
     number of the first operand in the command line.  The function
     returns 0 if all operands are already processed.  Returned number
     may be used as index of array returned by function
     'argument_vector' to access corresponding operand.

'Public function `number_of_operands''

                    `int number_of_operands (void)'


     returns number of operands in the command line.

'Public function `next_option''

                    `int next_option (int flag_of_first)'


     returns command line argument number of next option if the function
     parameter is nonzero.  Otherwise the function returns number of the
     first option in the command line.  The function returns 0 if all
     options are already processed.  Returned number may be used as
     index of array returned by function 'argument_vector' to access
     corresponding option.

'Function `option_characteristics''

                    `char *option_characteristics (int argument_number,
                                                   int *option_has_argument)'


     returns pointer to option name which describes the command line
     argument with number 'argument_number' given as the first parameter
     of the function.  The function returns NULL if the corresponding
     option in the command line description is not found or an option
     described as with option-argument has not option-argument in the
     command line.  Remember that option name with option-argument
     differs from option in the command line (e.g.  '-U' and '-Ufoo').
     If the option in the command line description is found than the
     function sets up correspondingly the second function parameter
     'option_has_argument'.  The case of returned NULL and
     '*option_has_argument' equals to TRUE means that given option must
     have option-argument but the option has not option-argument in the
     command line.

'Public function `last_option_place''

                    `int last_option_place (const char *option_name)'


     returns number of last option with given option name in the command
     line.  The function returns 0 if the option is absent in the
     command line.

'Public function `option_argument''

                    `char *option_argument (const char *option_name)'


     returns pointer to argument of last option in the command line with
     given option name.  The function returns NULL if the option is
     absent in the command line.  The function must be called only for
     options which have argument separated by white spaces.

'Public functions `argument_count', `argument_vector''

                    `int argument_count (void)'
                    `char **argument_vector (void)'


     return 'argc' and 'argv' of function 'main'.  See also description
     of the class constructor.

9 Package for work with bit strings
***********************************

The package for work with bit strings is used to implement package
'IEEE'. But of course the package can be used for solving other tasks.

   Here a bit is given by address (start address) of byte from which
counting bits starts and its displacement which is any non negative
number of bit from the start address.  The most significant bit of the
start address byte has number 0.  The bit string is given by its first
bit and its length in bits.

   The interface part of the package is file 'bits.h'.  The
implementation part is file 'bits.cpp'.  The interface contains only
class 'bits' without public constructors and destructors.  The class
contains the following members:

'Static public function `bit''

                    `int bit (const void *start_byte, int bit_displacement)'


     returns given bit value as integer value '0' or '1'.  There is
     static public function 'set_bit'

                    `void set_bit (void *start_byte, int bit_displacement,
                                   int bit)


     for changing value of a bit.  Parameter 'bit' must have value '0'
     or '1'.

'Static public function `is_zero_bit_string''

                    `int is_zero_bit_string (const void *start_byte,
                                             int bit_displacement,
                                             int bit_length)'


     returns '1' if given bit string contains only zero value bits, 0
     otherwise.

'Static public function `bit_string_set''

                    `void bit_string_set (void *start_byte, int
                                          bit_displacement, int bit,
                                          int bit_length)'


     sets up new value of all bits of given bit string.  This function
     is bit string analog of standard C++ function 'memset'.

'Static public function `bit_string_copy''

                    `void bit_string_copy (void *to, int to_bit_displacement,
                                           const void *from,
                                           int from_bit_displacement,
                                           int bit_length)'


     copys a bit string to another bit string.  The bit strings must be
     nonoverlapped.  This function is bit string analog of standard C++
     function 'memcpy'.

'Static public function `bit_string_move''

                    void bit_string_move (void *to, int to_bit_displacement,
                                          const void *from,
                                          int from_bit_displacement,
                                          int bit_length)'


     copys a bit string to another bit string.  The bit strings can be
     overlapped.  This function is bit string analog of standard C++
     function 'memmove'.

'Static public function `bit_string_comparison''

                    `int bit_string_comparison
                         (const void *str1, int bit_displacement1,
                          const void *str2, int bit_displacement2,
                          int bit_length)'


     returns 0 if the bit strings are equal, 1 if the first bit string
     is greater than the second, -1 if the first bit string is less than
     the second.  This function is bit string analog of standard C++
     function 'memcmp'.

10 Package for machine-independent arbitrary precision integer arithmetic
*************************************************************************

Abstract data 'arithm' may be used for implementation of a
cross-compiler.  This abstract data implements arbitrary precision
integer and unsigned integer number arithmetic by machine independent
way.  The implementation of the package functions are not sufficiently
efficient in order to use for run-time.  The package functions are
oriented to implement constant-folding in compilers.  This package is
necessary because host machine may not support such arithmetic for
target machine.  For example, VAX does not support does not support more
32-bits integer numbers arithmetic.

   The numbers in packages are represented by bytes in big endian mode,
negative integer numbers are represented in complementary code.  All
sizes are given in bytes and must be positive.  Results of executions of
all functions can coincide with a operand(s).  All functions of
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, evaluation of
remainder, shift, changing size and transformation of string into number
fix overflow.  The overflow is fixed when result can not be represented
by number of given size.

   The interface part of the abstract data is file 'arithm.h'.  The
implementation part is file 'arithm.cpp'.  The maximum length of integer
number is suggested to be not greater then 'MAX_INTEGER_OPERAND_SIZE'.
The default value (128) of this macro can be redefined with
corresponding C++ compiler option '-DMAX_INTEGER_OPERAND_SIZE=...'
during compilation of file 'arithm.cpp'.  But in any case the minimal
value of the macros will be 16.  The interface contains the following
external definitions:

'Class `integer''
     is auxialiary.  It serves to describe common variables and
     functions for work with signed and unsigned integers (classes
     'signed_integer' and 'unsigned_integer').  The class 'integer' has
     the following members.

     'Public static variable `overflow_bit''
          has only two values 0 or 1.  The value '1' corresponds to
          overflow.  The variable value are modified by all functions of
          addition, subtract, multiplication, division, evaluation of
          remainder, shift, changing size and transformation of string
          into number.

     'Public static variable `const unsigned char *zero_constant''
          represents zero (unsigned) integer of any size.

     'Public static function `default_arithmetic_overflow_reaction''

                          `void default_arithmetic_overflow_reaction (void)'


          Originally reaction on all integer and unsigned integer
          overflow is equal to this function.  The function does
          nothing.  Reaction on overflow for integers or unsigned
          integers is called after setting up variable 'overflow_bit'.

'Classes `signed_integer' and `unsigned_integer''
     are sub-classes of the class 'integer'.  The first class contains
     functions for implementation of signed integer arithmetic.  The
     second one contains functions for implementation of unsigned
     integer arithmetic.  The classes contains the following functions:

     'Static public function `set_overflow_reaction''

                          `void (*set_overflow_reaction
                                  (void (*function) (void))) (void)'


          change reaction on integer overflow and returns previous
          overflow reaction function.

     'Static public functions `maximum''

                          `void maximum   (int  size,  void  *result)'


          create given size (in bytes) maximal integer constant which is
          placed in memory whose address is given by the second
          parameter.

     'Static public functions `add''

                                     const void *op2,
                                     void *result)'


          make integer addition of integers of given size.  The
          functions fix overflow when result can not be represented by
          number of given size.  There are analogous functions which
          implement other operations:

                          `subtract',
                          `multiply',
                          `divide',
                          `remainder'.


     'Static public functions `shift_left''

          make left shift of integer of given size on given number of
          bits.  If number of bits is negative the functions make shift
          to right actually.  The functions fix overflow when result can
          not be represented by number of given size, i.e.  in other
          words the opposite shift (to right) results in number not
          equal to source operand.  There are analogous functions which
          implement another operation

     'Static public function `_or_''

                                      void *result)'


          make bitwise 'or' of integers of given size.  There are
          analogous functions which implement bitwise 'and' and 'xor':

                          `_and_',
                          `_xor_'.

          compare two integers of given size on equality and returns 1
          or 0 depending on result of the comparison.  There are
          analogous functions which implement other integer operations:

                          `ne',
                          `gt',
                          `lt',
                          `ge',
                          and `le'.


     'Static public functions `change_size''

                          `void  change_size (int operand_size,

                                              int result_size, void *result)'

          transform integer of given size to decimal ascii
          representation.  Sign is present in result string only for
          negative numbers (it is not possible for the function in class
          'unsigned_integer').  The functions return value 'result'.

     'Static public functions `to_based_string''

                          `char *to_based_string (int  size, const void *operand,

          transform integer of given size to ascii representation with
          given base.  The base should be between 2 and 36 including
          them.  Digits more 9 are represented by 'a', 'b' etc.  Sign is
          present in result string only for negative numbers (it is not
          possible for the function in class 'unsigned_integer').  The

          transforms the tail of the source string (decimal ascii
          representation with possible sign '+' or '-' only for the
          function in class 'signed_integer') to given size integer and
          return pointer to first non digit in the source string.  If
          the string started with invalid integer representation the
          result will be zero.  The functions fix overflow when result

          are represented by 'a' (or 'A'), 'b' (or 'B') etc.  If the

'Classes `sint' and `unsint''
     Classes 'signed_integer' and 'unsigned_integer' containing only
     static function are simply written in C style.  Object oriented
     implementation of integer arithmetic requires C++ template classes
     which is not supported all C++ compilers.  Therefore if you define
     macro 'NO_TEMPLATE' before inclusion of interface file, classes
     'sint' and 'unsint' will be absent.  The classes is parameterized
     by size of integers (in bytes).  As the classes are subclasses of
     'signed_integer' and 'unsigned_integer', you can members
     'overflow_bit', 'set_overflow_reaction' to work with arithmetic
     overflow.  The classes have the following memebers:

     'Public constructors `sint', `unsint''

                          `sint (int value)', `sint (void)'
                          `unsint (unsigned int value)', `unsint (void)'


          can be used for creation integer with given value or zero
          integer.

     'Static public functions `max', `min''

                          `class sint<size> max (void)'
                          `class sint<size> min (void)'
                          `class unsint<size> max (void)'
                          `class unsint<size> min (void)'


          create integers and unsigned integers of maximal and minimal
          value.

                          `class unsint<size> operator +
                                              (const class unsint<size> &op)'


          make integer addition of integers of given size.  The operator
          fixes overflow when result can not be represented by number of
          given size.  There are analogous operators which implement
          other operations:

                          `-',
                          `*',
                          `/',

     'Public operators `<<''

                          `class sint<size> operator << (int bits)'
                          `class unsint<size> operator << (int bits)'


          make left shift of integer on given number of bits.  If number
          of bits is negative operator makes shift to right actually.
          The operators fix overflow when result can not be represented
          by number of given size, i.e.  in other words the opposite
          shift (to right) results in number not equal to source
          operand.  There are analogous operators which implement

                          `^'.


          Public operators

                          `int operator == (const class unsint<size> &op)'


          compare two integers of given size on equality and returns 1
          or 0 depending on result of the comparison.  There are
          analogous operators which implement other integer operations:

                          `!=',
                          `>',
                          `<',

          present in result string only for negative numbers (it is not
          possible for the function in class 'unsint').  The functions
          return value 'result'.

     'Public functions `to_based_str''

                          `char *to_based_str (int base, char *result)'


          transform integer to ascii representation with given base.
          The base should be between 2 and 36 including them.  Digits
          more 9 are represented by 'a', 'b' etc.  Sign is present in
          result string only for negative numbers (it is not possible
          for the function in class 'unsint').  The functions return
          value 'result'.

                          `char *from_str (const char *operand)'

          transforms the tail of the source string (decimal ascii
          representation with possible sign '+' or '-' only for the
          function in class 'signed_integer') to given integer and
          return pointer to first non digit in the source string.  If
          the string started with invalid integer representation the
          result will be zero.  The functions fixe overflow when result
          can not be represented by number of given size.

11 Package for machine-independent IEEE floating point arithmetic
*****************************************************************

Abstract data 'IEEE' may be used for implementation of a cross-compiler.
This abstract data implements IEEE floating point arithmetic by machine
independent way with the aid of package 'arithm'.  This abstract data is
necessary because host machine may not support such arithmetic for
target machine.  For example, VAX does not support IEEE floating point
arithmetic.  The floating point numbers are represented by bytes in big
endian mode.  The implementation of the package functions are not
sufficiently efficient in order to use for run-time.  The package
functions are oriented to implement constant-folding in compilers.  All
integer sizes (see transformation functions) are given in bytes and must
be positive.

   Functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
conversion of floating point numbers of different formats can fix input
exceptions.  If an operand of such operation is trapping (signal) not a
number then invalid operation and reserved operand exceptions are fixed
and the result is (quiet) NaN, otherwise if an operand is (quiet) NaN
then only reserved operand exception is fixed and the result is (quiet)
NaN. Operation specific processing the rest of special case values of
operands is placed with description of the operation.  In general case
the function can fix output exceptions and produces results for
exception according to the following table.  The result and status for a
given exceptional operation are determined by the highest priority
exception.  If, for example, an operation produces both overflow and
imprecise result exceptions, the overflow exception, having higher
priority, determines the behavior of the operation.  The behavior of
this operation is therefore described by the Overflow entry of the
table.

         Exception|Condition|                     |Result |Status

   The package uses package 'bits'.  The interface part of the abstract
data is file 'IEEE.h'.  The implementation part is file 'IEEE.cpp'.  The
interface contains the following external definitions:

'Macros `IEEE_FLOAT_SIZE', `IEEE_DOUBLE_SIZE', `IEEE_QUAD_SIZE''
     have values which are are sizes of IEEE single, double and quad
     precision floating point numbers ('4', '8', and '16'
     correspondingly).

'Macros `MAX_SINGLE_10_STRING_LENGTH','
     'MAX_DOUBLE_10_STRING_LENGTH', 'MAX_QUAD_10_STRING_LENGTH' have
     values which are maximal length of string generated by functions
     creating decimal ascii representation of IEEE floats (see functions
     to_string).

'Macros `MAX_SINGLE_16_STRING_LENGTH','
     'MAX_DOUBLE_16_STRING_LENGTH', 'MAX_QUAD_16_STRING_LENGTH',
     'MAX_SINGLE_8_STRING_LENGTH', 'MAX_DOUBLE_8_STRING_LENGTH',
     'MAX_QUAD_8_STRING_LENGTH', 'MAX_SINGLE_4_STRING_LENGTH',
     'MAX_DOUBLE_4_STRING_LENGTH', 'MAX_QUAD_4_STRING_LENGTH',
     'MAX_SINGLE_2_STRING_LENGTH', 'MAX_DOUBLE_2_STRING_LENGTH',
     'MAX_QUAD_2_STRING_LENGTH' have values which are maximal length of
     string generated by functions creating binary ascii representation
     of IEEE floats with given base (see functions to_binary_string).

'Types `IEEE_float_t', `IEEE_double_t', and'
     'IEEE_quad_t' are simply synonyms of classes 'IEEE_float',
     'IEEE_double', and 'IEEE_quad' representing correspondingly IEEE
     single precision, double, and quad precision floating point
     numbers.

'Constants `IEEE_RN', `IEEE_RM', `IEEE_RP', `IEEE_RZ''
     defines rounding control (round to nearest representable number,
     round toward minus infinity, round toward plus infinity, round
     toward zero).

     Round to nearest means the result produced is the representable
     value nearest to the infinitely-precise result.  There are special
     cases when infinitely precise result falls exactly halfway between
     two representable values.  In this cases the result will be
     whichever of those two representable values has a fractional part
     whose least significant bit is zero.

     Round toward minus infinity means the result produced is the
     representable value closest to but no greater than the infinitely
     precise result.

     Round toward plus infinity means the result produced is the
     representable value closest to but no less than the infinitely
     precise result.

     Round toward zero, i.e.  the result produced is the representable
     value closest to but no greater in magnitude than the infinitely
     precise result.

'Class `IEEE''
     The class has the following functions common for all packages:

     'Static public function `reset''

                          `void reset (void)'


          and to separate bits in mask returned by functions

          and to separate bits in mask returned by functions

                          `IEEE_get_sticky_status_bits',
                          `IEEE_get_status_bits', and
                          `IEEE_get_trap_mask'.


     'Static public function `get_trap_mask''

                          `int get_trap_mask (void)'


          returns exceptions trap mask.  Static public function

                          `int set_trap_mask (int mask)'


          sets up new exception trap mask and returns the previous.

          If the mask bit corresponding given exception is set, a
          floating point exception trap does not occur for given
          exception.  Such exception is said to be masked exception.
          Initial exception trap mask is zero.  Remember that more one
          exception may be occurred simultaneously.

     'Static public function `set_sticky_status_bits''

                          `int set_sticky_status_bits (int mask)'


          changes sticky status bits and returns the previous bits.

          Static public function

                          `int get_sticky_status_bits (void)'


          returns mask of current sticky status bits.  Only sticky
          status bits corresponding to masked exceptions are updated
          regardless whether a floating point exception trap is taken or
          not.  Initial values of sticky status bits are zero.

     'Static public function `get_status_bits''

                          `int get_status_bits (void)'


          returns mask of status bits.  It is supposed that the function
          will be used in trap on an floating point exception.  Status
          bits are updated regardless of the current exception trap mask
          only when a floating point exception trap is taken.  Initial
          values of status bits are zero.

     'Static public functions `set_round', `get_round''

                          `int set_round (int round_mode)'


          which sets up current rounding mode and returns previous mode
          and

                          `int IEEE_get_round (void)'


          which returns current mode.  Initial rounding mode is round to
          nearest.

     'Static public function `default_floating_point_exception_trap''

                          `void default_floating_point_exception_trap (void)'


          Originally reaction on occurred trap on an unmasked floating
          point exception is equal to this function.  The function does
          nothing.  All occurred exceptions can be found in the trap
          with the aid of status bits.

     'Static public function `set_floating_point_exception_trap''

                          `void (*set_floating_point_exception_trap
                                  (void (*function) (void))) (void)'


          sets up trap on an unmasked exception.  Function given as
          parameter simulates floating point exception trap.

'Classes `IEEE_float', `IEEE_double', and `IEEE_quad''
     The classes implements IEEE floating point numbers in
     object-oriented style.  The following functions are described for
     class 'IEEE_float'.  The classes 'IEEE_double' and 'IEEE_quad' have
     analogous functions (if details are absent) with the same names but
     for IEEE double and quad numbers.

     'Public constructors `IEEE_float', `IEEE_double', `IEEE_quad''

                          `IEEE_float (void)'
                          `IEEE_float (float f)'
                          `IEEE_double (void)'
                          `IEEE_double (float f)'
                          `IEEE_quad (void)'
                          `IEEE_quad (float f)'


          creates IEEE single, IEEE double, or IEEE quad precision
          numbers with pozitive zero values or with given value.

     'Public function `positive_zero''

                          `void positive_zero (void)'


          Given float becomes positive single precision zero constant.
          There are analogous functions which return other special case
          values:

                          `negative_zero',
                          `NaN',
                          `trapping_NaN',
                          `positive_infinity',
                          `negative_infinity',


          According to the IEEE standard NaN (and trapping NaN) can be
          represented by more one bit string.  But all functions of the
          package generate and use only one its representation created
          by function 'NaN' (and 'trapping_NaN'). A (quiet) NaN does not
          cause an Invalid Operation exception and can be reported as an
          operation result.  A trapping NaN causes an Invalid Operation
          exception if used as in input operand to floating point
          operation.  Trapping NaN can not be reported as an operation
          result.

     'Public function `is_positive_zero''

                          `int is_positive_zero (void)'


          returns 1 if given number is positive single precision zero
          constant.  There are analogous functions for other special
          case values:

                          `is_negative_zero',
                          `is_NaN',
                          `is_trapping_NaN',
                          `is_positive_infinity',
                          `is_negative_infinity',
                          `is_positive_maximum' (positive max value),
                          `is_negative_maximum',
                          `is_positive_minimum' (positive min value),
                          `is_negative_minimum',


          In spite of that all functions of the package generate and use
          only one its representation created by function 'NaN' (or
          'trapping_NaN'). The function 'is_NaN' (and 'trapping_NaN')
          determines any representation of NaN.

     'Public function `is_normalized''

                          `int is_normalized (void)'


          returns TRUE if given number is normalized (special case
          values are not normalized).  There is analogous function

                          `is_denormalized'


          for determination of denormalized number.

     'Public operator `+''

                          `class IEEE_float operator + (class IEEE_float &op)'


          makes single precision addition of floating point numbers.
          There are analogous operators which implement other floating
          point operations:

                          `-',
                          `*',
                          `/',

     'Public functions `to_string''

                          `char *to_string (char *result)'


          transform single precision to decimal ascii representation
          with obligatory integer part (1 digit), fractional part (of
          constant length), and optional exponent.  Signs minus are
          present if it is needed.  The special cases IEEE floating
          point values are represented by strings 'SNaN', 'QNaN',
          '+Inf', '-Inf', '+0', and '-0'.  The functions return value
          'result'.  Current round mode does not affect the resultant
          ascii representation.  The functions output 9 decimal fraction

          fractional part of given base, and optional binary exponent
          (decimal number giving power of 2).  The binary exponent
          starts with character 'p' instead of 'e'.  Signs minus are
          present if it is needed.  The special cases IEEE floating
          point values are represented by strings 'SNaN', 'QNaN',
          '+Inf', '-Inf', '+0', and '-0'.  The functions return value
          'result'.  Value of parameter base should be 2, 4, 8, or 16.
          Current round mode does not affect the resultant ascii
          representation.

     'Public functions `from_string''

                          `char *from_string (const char *operand)'


          skip all white spaces at the begin of source string and
          transforms tail of the source string to single precision
          floating point number.  The number must correspond the
          following syntax

                             ['+' | '-'] [<decimal digits>]
                                         [ '.' [<decimal digits>] ]
                                  [ ('e' | 'E') ['+' | '-'] <decimal digits>]


          or must be the following strings 'SNaN', 'QNaN', '+Inf',
          '-Inf', '+0', or '-0'.  The functions return pointer to first
          character in the source string after read floating point
          number.  If the string does not correspond floating point
          number syntax the result will be zero and functions return the
          source string.

          The functions can fix output exceptions as described above.
          Current round mode may affect resultant floating point number.
          It is guaranteed that transformation 'IEEE floating point
          number -> string -> IEEE floating point number' results in the
          same IEEE floating point number if round to nearest mode is
          used.  But the reverse transformation 'string with 9 (or 17)
          digits -> IEEE floating point number -> string' may results in
          different digits of the fractions in ascii representation
          because a floating point number may represent several such
          strings with differences in the least significant digit.  But
          the ascii representations are identical when the functions for
          IEEE single, double, and quad precision numbers do not fix
          imprecise result exception or less than 9 (17 or 36) digits of
          the fractions in the ascii representations are compared.

     'Public functions `from_binary_string''

                          `char *from_binary_string (const char *operand, int base)'


          The functions ar analogous to to_string but transform binary
          representation of the floating point number.  The number must
          correspond the following syntax

                             ['+' | '-'] [<digits less base>] [ '.' [<digits less base>] ]
                                  [ ('p' | 'P') ['+' | '-'] <decimal digits>]


          or must be the following strings 'SNaN', 'QNaN', '+Inf',
          '-Inf', '+0', or '-0'.  The functions return pointer to first
          character in the source string after read floating point
          number.  If the string does not correspond floating point
          number syntax the result will be zero and function returns the
          source string.  The exponent (after character 'p' or 'P')
          defines power of two.

          The functions can fix output exceptions as described above.
          Current round mode can affect resultant floating point number
          if there are too many given digits.

'Template transformation functions'
     As mentioned above there are template classes 'sint' and 'unsint'
     of package 'arithm'.  Therefore package 'IEEE' contains template
     functions for transformation of between IEEE numbers and integer
     numbers.  As in package 'arithm' if you define macro 'NO_TEMPLATE'
     before inclusion of interface file, these template transformation
     functions will be absent.  There are the following functions:

     Exceptions for these functions are the same as described above for
     functions 'from_signed_integer', 'to_signed_integer' and so on.

   Important note: All items (they contains word quad or QUAD in their
names) relative to IEEE 128 bits floating point numbers are defined only
when macro 'IEEE_QUAD' is defined.  By default 'IEEE_QUAD' is not
defined.  It is made because supporting IEEE 18-bits numbers requires
more 100Kb memory.

12 Ticker package
*****************

The package 'ticker' implements a timer.  Timer can be activated or can
be stopped.  The timer accumulates execution time only when it is in
active state.  The interface part of the package is file 'ticker.h'.
The implementation part is file 'ticker.cpp'.  The interface contains
the following external definitions and macros:

'Type `ticker_t''
     describes a timer.  This type is simply synonym of 'class ticker'.

'Class `ticker''
     Timers are objects of this class.  The class has the following
     members:

     'Public constructor `ticker''

                            `ticker (void)'


          creates new timer.  The state of the timer is active.

     'Public function `ticker_off''

                            `void ticker_off (void)'


          stops given timer.

     'Public function `ticker_on''

                            `void ticker_on (void)'


          activates given timer.

     'Function `active_time''

                            `double active_time (ticker_t ticker)'


          returns time in seconds as double float value in which the
          timer given as the function parameter was active.

     'Function `active_time_string''

                            `const char *active_time_string (ticker_t ticker)'


          returns string representation of time in seconds in which the
          timer given as the function parameter was active.  Remember
          that this function must be the single in a C++ expression
          because the string is stored in a static variable of the
          function.

13 Expandable sparse set
************************

The package 'bits' can be used to represent sets.  In many applications
(e.g.  in compiler optimizations) sets are sparse for all possible
elements values.  The package 'spset' implements sparse sets described
in "An Efficient Representation for Sparse Sets" by Preston Briggs and
Linda Torczon.  The sparse set implementation has the following
features:

   * It is fast.  It has complexity O(1) for testing, insertion, remove
     of the element and O(n) for union, intersection, difference,
     comparison, and traverse of the sets, where 'n' is number of
     elements in the set.
   * The set has a size.  Elements with values less than size can be
     stored in the set.  The memory is needed for the set representation
     is O(size).
   * When the element is inserted and does not fit into the set, the set
     is automatically extended to store the element and may be elements
     with even bigger values.

   The interface part of the sparse set is file 'spset.h'.  The
implementation part is file 'spset.cpp'.  The interface contains the
following external definitions and macros:

'Type `spset_elem_t''
     is an unsigned integer type representing the set element.

'Macro `SPSET_MAX_ELEM''
     is a maximal possible value of the previous type.

'Class `spset''
     The class contains the following functions:

     'Public constructor `spset''

                         `spset (spset_elem_t size = 0)'


          creates set with initial size close to 'size' but not less
          than it.  With default parameter value the minimal size set is
          created.

     'Public destructor ` spset''

                         `~spset (vodi)'


          deletes given set and frees memory allocated for it.

     'Public member function `size''

                          `spset_elem_t size (void)'


          returns the current size of the set.  Elements with values
          less than the size can be inserted without an expansion.

     'Public member function `cardinality''

                          `spset_elem_t cardinality (void)'


          returns number of elements containing currently in the set.

     'Public member function `copy''

                          `void copy (spset *from)'


          copies value of set 'from' to given set.

     'Public member function `swap''

                          `void swap (spset *s)'


          swaps values of given set and 's'.

     'Public member function `in_p''

                          `int in_p (spset_elem_t el)'


          returns TRUE if the set constains element 'el'.

     'Public member function `insert''

                          `int insert (spset_elem_t el)'


          inserts element 'el' into the set.  Return TRUE if the set has
          been changed, in order words, it did not contain the element.
          If the set size is not enough to contain the element, the set
          is expanded.

     'Public member function `remove''

                          `int remove (spset_elem_t el)'


          removes element 'el' from the set.  Return TRUE if the set has
          been changed, in order words, it really contained the element.

     'Public member function `clear''

                          `int clear (void)'


          removes all elements from the set.  Return TRUE if the set has
          been changed, in order words, it was not empty.

     'Public member function `equal_p''

                          `int equal_p (spset *s)'

                          `int intersect (spset *s)'


          removes elements in given set which are not is set 's'.
          Returns TRUE if the set has been changed, in order words, if
          given set or 's' had any non-common elements.

     'Public member function `unity''

                          `int unity (spset *s)'


          adds all elements of set 's' to given set.  Returns TRUE if
          the set has been changed, in order words, if any new element
          was added to given set.  The set can be automatically expanded
          if it is necessary.

     'Public member function `diff''

                          `int intersect (spset *s)'


          removes all elements of set 's' from given set.  Returns TRUE

                          `void shrink (void)'


          decreases size of the set if it is possible.  During set life,
          the set can be automatically expanded but it is never
          automatically shrinked.  After some element removes, it might
          be possible to shrink set size to save memory.  The function
          serves this purpose.

     'Public static function `release_unused_memory''

                          `void release_unused_memory (void)'


          releases internal memory pool.  The pool is used to speed up
          size changing of sets.  It is wise to call the function when
          you finish to work with all sets.

     'Public member function `print''

                          `void print (FILE *f)'


          prints all elements of the set into file 'f'.

     'Public member function `debug''

                          `void debug (void)'


          prints all elements of the set into stderr.

'Class `spset_iterator''
     is used to define iterators for traverses of sets (see the macro
     below).

'Macro `EXECUTE_FOR_EACH_SPSET_ELEM''

                  `EXECUTE_FOR_EACH_SPSET_ELEM (SET, EL, SI) c++-stmt'


     executes 'c++-stmt' for each element of 'SET'. During execution,
     the current element value is assigned to 'EL'. You need to declare
     somewhere and use iterator 'SI' in the macro call.  The order of
     traverse of the set elements is undefined.  The traverse behaviour
     when the traversed set is changed during the traverse is not
     defined.

14 Expandable compact sparse set
********************************

The package 'spsets' can be used to represent few sets as the set memory
is proportional to maximal possible element value.  And as this value
can be big, the sets can be big too.  In some applications (e.g.  basic
block pseudo live info at the beginning and end of each basic block in
compiler) you need a lot of sets and spset package is not acceptable for
such uses as it will require huge memory.  We need a set representation
whose memory is proportional to number of set elements which for sparse
sets is much smaller than maximal possible element value.  The package
'cspset' (expandable compact sparse sets) implements such
representation.  We use special case hash tables of appropriate sizes to
keep the tables compact but still fast for access.  The algorithm
complexities of set operations in practice is the same as for package
'spset' but have bigger constants.

   The interface part of the sparse set is file 'cspset.h'.  The
implementation part is file 'cspset.cpp'.  The interface is very similar
to 'spset' one.  It contains the following external definitions and
macros:

'Type `cspset_elem_t''
     is an unsigned integer type representing the set element.  It is
     the same type as spset_elem_t.

'Constant `cspset_max_elem''
     is a maximal possible value of the previous type for the element.
     That is pretty big value very close to maximal value of the above
     type.

'Class `cspset''
     describes a compact sparse set.  The class contains the following
     functions:

     'Public constructor `cspset''

                           `cspset (cspset_elem_t size = 0)'


          creates set with initial size close to 'size' but not less
          than it.  With default parameter value the minimal size set is
          created.

     'Public destructor ` cspset''

                           `~cspset (vodi)'


          deletes given set and frees memory allocated for it.

     'Public member function `size''

                            `cspset_elem_t size (void)'


          returns the current size of the set.  The set without an
          expansion can contain elements whose quantity is close to the
          set size.

     'Public member function `cardinality''

                            `cspset_elem_t cardinality (void)'


          returns number of elements containing currently in the set.

     'Public member function `copy''

                            `void copy (cspset *from)'


          copies value of set 'from' to given set.

     'Public member function `swap''

                            `void swap (cspset *s)'


          swaps values of given set and 's'.

                            `int in_p (cspset_elem_t el)'


          returns TRUE if the set constains element 'el'.

     'Public member function `insert''

                            `int insert (cspset_elem_t el)'


          inserts element 'el' into the set.  Return TRUE if the set has
          been changed, in order words, it did not contain the element.

          is expanded.

     'Public member function `remove''

                            `int remove (cspset_elem_t el)'

          given set or 's' had any non-common elements.

     'Public member function `unity''

                            `int unity (cspset *s)'


          adds all elements of set 's' to given set.  Returns TRUE if
          the set has been changed, in order words, if any new element
          was added to given set.  The set can be automatically expanded
          if it is necessary.

15 Earley parser
****************

The package 'earley' implements earley parser.  The earley parser
implementation has the following features:

   * It is sufficiently fast and does not require much memory.  This is
     the fastest implementation of Earley parser which I know.  The main
     design goal is to achieve speed and memory requirements which are
     necessary to use it in prototype compilers and language processors.
     It parses 30K lines of C program per second on 500 MHz Pentium III
     and allocates about 5Mb memory for 10K line C program.
   * It makes simple syntax directed translation.  So an abstract tree
     is already the output of Earley parser.
   * It can parse input described by an ambiguous grammar.  In this case
     the parse result can be an abstract tree or all possible abstract
     trees.  Moreover it produces the compact representation of all
     possible parse trees by using DAG instead of real trees.  This
     feature can be used to parse natural language sentences.
   * It can parse input described by an ambiguous grammar according to
     the abstract node costs.  In this case the parse result can be an
     minimal cost abstract tree or all possible minimal cost abstract
     trees.  This feature can be used to code selection task in
     compilers.
   * It can make syntax error recovery.  Moreover its error recovery
     algorithms finds error recovery with minimal number of ignored
     tokens.  It permits to implement parsers with very good error
     recovery and reporting.
   * It has fast startup.  There is no practically delay between
     processing grammar and start of parsing.
   * It has flexible interface.  The input grammar can be given by
     YACC-like description or providing functions returning terminals
     and rules.
   * It has good debugging features.  It can print huge amount of
     information about grammar, parsing, error recovery, translation.
     You can even output the result translation in form for a graphic
     visualization program.

   The interface part of the parser is file 'earley.h'.  The
implementation part is file 'earley.cpp'.  The interface contains the
following external definitions and macros:

'Macro `EARLEY_NIL_TRANSLATION_NUMBER''
     is reserved to be designation of empty node for translation.

'Macro `EARLEY_NO_MEMORY''
     is error code of the parser.  The parser functions return the code
     when parser can not allocate enough memory for its work.

'Macro `EARLEY_UNDEFINED_OR_BAD_GRAMMAR''
     is error code of the parser.  The parser functions return the code
     when we call parsing without defining grammar or call parsing for
     bad defined grammar.

'Macro `EARLEY_DESCRIPTION_SYNTAX_ERROR_CODE''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the grammar
     is defined by description and there is syntax error in the
     description.

'Macro `EARLEY_FIXED_NAME_USAGE''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the grammar
     uses reserved names for terminals and nonterminals.  There are two
     reserved names '$S' (for axiom) and '$eof' for end of file (input
     end marker).  The parser adds these symbols and rules with these
     symbols to the grammar given by user.  So user should not use these
     names in his grammar.

'Macro `EARLEY_REPEATED_TERM_DECL''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the grammar
     contains several declarations of terminals with the same name.

'Macro `EARLEY_NEGATIVE_TERM_CODE''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the grammar
     terminal is described with negative code.

'Macro `EARLEY_REPEATED_TERM_CODE''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the two or
     more grammar terminals are described with the same code.

'Macro `EARLEY_NO_RULES''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the grammar
     given by user has no rules.

'Macro `EARLEY_TERM_IN_RULE_LHS''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when grammar
     rule given by user contains terminal in left hand side of the rule.

'Macro `EARLEY_INCORRECT_TRANSLATION''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when grammar
     rule translation is not correct.  The single reason for this is
     translation of the rule consists of translations of more one
     symbols in the right hand side of the rule without forming an
     abstract tree node.

'Macro `EARLEY_NEGATIVE COST''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when abstract
     node has a negative cost.

'Macro `EARLEY_INCORRECT_SYMBOL_NUMBER''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when grammar
     rule translation contains incorrect symbol number which should be
     nonnegative number less than rule right hand side length.

'Macro `EARLEY_UNACCESSIBLE_NONTERM''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when there is
     grammar nonterminal which can not be derived from axiom.

'Macro `EARLEY_NONTERM_DERIVATION''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when there is
     grammar nonterminal which can not derive a terminal string.

'Macro `EARLEY_LOOP_NONTERM''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when there is
     grammar nonterminal which can derive only itself.  The parser does
     not work with such grammars.

'Macro `EARLEY_INVALID_TOKEN_CODE''
     is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the parser
     got input token whose code is different from all grammar terminal
     codes.

'Enumeration `earley_tree_node_type''
     describes all possible nodes of abstract tree representing the
     translation.  There are the following enumeration constants:

     '`EARLEY_NIL''
          the corresponding node represents empty translations.

     '`EARLEY_ERROR''
          the corresponding node represents translation of special
          terminal 'error' (see error recovery).

     '`EARLEY_TERM''
          the corresponding node represents translation of a terminal.

     '`EARLEY_ANODE''
          the corresponding node represents an abstract node.

     '`EARLEY_ALT''
          the corresponding node represents an alternative of the
          translation.  Such nodes creates only when there are two or
          more possible translations.  It means that the grammar is
          ambiguous.

'Structure `earley_tree_node''
     represents node of the translation.  The nodes refer for each other
     forming DAG (direct acyclic graph) in general case.  The main
     reason of generating DAG is that some input fragments may have the
     same translation, when there are several parsings of input (which
     is possible only for ambiguous grammars).  But DAG may be created
     even for unambigous grammar because some nodes (empty and error
     nodes) exist only in one exemplar.  When such nodes are not
     created, the translation nodes forms a tree.  This structure has
     the following members:

     'Member `type' of type `enum earley_tree_node_type''
          representing type of the translation node.

     'Union `val''
          Depending on the translation node type, one of the union
          members 'nil', 'error', 'term', 'anode', and 'alt' of the
          structure types described below is used to represent the
          translation node.

'Structure `earley_nil''
     represents empty node.  It has no members.  Actually the
     translation is DAG (not tree) in general case.  The empty and error
     nodes are present only in one exemplar.

'Structure `earley_error''
     represents translation of special terminal 'error'.  It has no
     members.  The error node exists only in one exemplar.

'Structure `earley_term''
     represents translation of terminals.  It has the following two
     members:

     'Integer member `code''
          representing code of the corresponding terminal.

     'Member `cost' of type `int''
          representing cost of the node plus costs of all children if
          the cost flag is set up.  Otherwise, the value is cost of the
          abstract node itself.

     'Member `attr' of type `* void''
          is reference for the attribute of the corresponding terminal.

'Structure `earley_anode''
     represents abstract node.  It has the following two members:

     'Member `name' of type `const char *''
          representing name of anode as it given in the corresponding
          rule translation.

     'Member `children' of type `struct earley_tree_node **''
          is array of nodes representing the translations of the symbols
          given in the rule with the abstract node.

'Structure `earley_alt''
     represents an alternative of the translation.  It has the following
     two members:

     'Member `node' of type `struct earley_tree_node *''
          representing alternative translation.

     'Member `next' of type `struct earley_tree_node *''
          is reference for the next alternative of translation.

'Class `earley''
     Earley parsers are objects of this class.  The class has the
     following members:

     'Public constructor `earley''

                            `earley (void)'


          creates new parser.  The grammar of the parser is not defined.

     'Public destructor'

                            `~earley (void)'


          frees all memory allocated for the parser.

     'Public function `error_code''

                            `int error_code (void)'


          returns the last occurred error code (see the possible error
          codes above) for given parser.  If the function returns zero,
          no error was found so far.

     'Public function `error_message''

                            `const char *error_message (void)'


          returns detail message about last occurred error.  The message
          always corresponds to the last error code returned the
          previous function.

     'Public function `read_grammar''

                            `int read_grammar (int strict_p,
                                               const char *(*read_terminal) (int *code),
                                               const char *(*read_rule)
                                                           (const char ***rhs,
                                                            const char **abs_node,
                                                            int *anode_cost,
                                                            int **transl))'


          is one of two functions which tunes the parser to given
          grammar.  The grammar is read with the aid functions given as
          parameters.

          'read_terminal' is function for reading terminals.  This
          function is called before function 'read_rule'.  The function
          should return the name and the code of the next terminal.  If
          all terminals have been read the function returns NULL. The
          terminal code should be nonnegative.

          'read_rule' is function called to read the next rule.  This
          function is called after function 'read_terminal'.  The
          function should return the name of nonterminal in the left
          hand side of the rule and array of names of symbols in the
          right hand side of the rule (the array end marker should be
          'NULL'). If all rules have been read, the function returns
          'NULL'. All symbol with name which was not provided function
          'read_terminal' are considered to be nonterminals.  The
          function also returns translation given by abstract node name
          and its fields which will be translation of symbols (with
          indexes given in array given by parameter 'transl') in the
          right hand side of the rule.  All indexes in 'transl' should
          be different (so the translation of a symbol can not be
          represented twice).  The end marker of the array should be a
          negative value.  There is a reserved value of the translation
          symbol number denoting empty node.  It is value defined by
          macro 'EARLEY_NIL_TRANSLATION_NUMBER'. If parameter 'transl'
          is 'NULL' or contains only the end marker, translations of the
          rule will be empty node.  If 'abs_node' is 'NULL', abstract
          node is not created.  In this case 'transl' should be null or
          contain at most one element.  This means that the translation
          of the rule will be correspondingly empty node or the
          translation of the symbol in the right hand side given by the
          single array element.  The cost of the abstract node if given
          is passed through parameter 'anode_cost'.  If 'abs_node' is
          not 'NULL', the cost should be greater or equal to zero.
          Otherwise the cost is ignored.

          There is reserved terminal 'error' which is used to mark start
          point of error recovery.

          Nonzero parameter 'strict_p' value means more strict checking
          the grammar.  In this case, all nonterminals will be checked
          on ability to derive a terminal string instead of only
          checking axiom for this.

          The function returns zero if it is all ok.  Otherwise, the
          function returns the error code occured.

     'Public function `parse_grammar''

                            `int parse_grammar (int strict_p, const char *description)'


          is another function which tunes the parser to given grammar.
          The grammar is given by string 'description'.  The description
          is similiar YACC one.  It has the following syntax:

                               file : file terms [';']
                                    | file rule
                                    | terms [';']
                                    | rule

                               terms : terms IDENTIFIER ['=' NUMBER]
                                     | TERM

                               rule : IDENTIFIER ':' rhs [';']

                               rhs : rhs '|' sequence [translation]
                                   | sequence [translation]

                               sequence :
                                        | sequence IDENTIFIER
                                        | sequence C_CHARACTER_CONSTANT

                               translation : '#'
                                           | '#' NUMBER
                                           | '#' '-'
                                           | '#' IDENTIFIER '(' numbers ')'

                               numbers :
                                       | numbers NUMBER
                                       | numbers '-'


          So the description consists of terminal declaration and rules
          sections.

          Terminal declaration section describes name of terminals and
          their codes.  Terminal code is optional.  If it is omitted,
          the terminal code will the next free code starting with 256.
          You can declare terminal several times (the single condition
          its code should be the same).

          Character constant present in the rules is a terminal
          described by default.  Its code is always code of the
          character constant.

          Rules syntax is the same as YACC rule syntax.  The single
          difference is an optional translation construction starting
          with '#' right after each alternative.  The translation part
          could be a single number which means that the translation of
          the alternative will be the translation of the symbol with
          given number (symbol numbers in alternative starts with 0).
          Or the translation can be empty or '-' which mean empty node.
          Or the translation can be abstract node with given name,
          optional cost, and with fields whose values are the
          translations of the alternative symbols with numbers given in
          parentheses after the abstract node name.  You can use '-' in
          abstract node to show that empty node should be used in this
          place.  If the cost is absent it is believed to be one.  The
          cost of terminal, error node, and empty node is always zero.

          There is reserved terminal 'error' which is used to mark start
          point of error recovery.

     'Public function `set_lookahead_level''

                            `int set_lookahead_level (int level)'


          sets up level of usage of look ahead in parser work.  Value
          zero means no usage of lookaheads at all.  Lookahead with
          static (independent on input tokens) context sets in parser
          situation (value 1) gives the best results with the point of
          view of space and speed, lookahead with dynamic (dependent on
          input tokens) context sets in parser situations (all the rest
          parameter values) does slightly worse, and no usage of
          lookaheads does the worst.  The default value is 1 (lookahead
          with static situation context sets).  The function returns the
          previously set up level.  If the level value is negative, zero
          is used instead of it.  If the value is greater than two, two
          is used in this case.

     'Public function `set_debug_level''

                            `int set_debug_level (int level)'


          sets up level of debugging information output to 'stderr'.
          The more level, the more information is output.  The default
          value is 0 (no output).  The debugging information includes
          statistics, result translation tree, grammar, parser sets,
          parser sets with all situations, situations with contexts.
          The function returns the previously set up debug level.
          Setting up negative debug level results in output of
          translation for program 'dot' of graphic visualization package
          'graphviz'.

     'Public function `set_one_parse_flag''

                            `int set_one_parse_flag (int flag)'


          sets up building only one translation tree (parameter value 0)
          or all parse trees for ambiguous grammar for which several
          parsings are possible.  For unambiguous grammar the flag does
          not affect the result.  The default value is 1.  The function
          returns the previously used flag value.

     'Public function `earley_set_cost_flag''

                            `int set_cost_flag (int flag)'


          sets up building only translation tree (trees if we set up
          one_parse_flag to 0) with minimal cost.  For unambiguous
          grammar the flag does not affect the result.  The default
          value is 0.  The function returns the previously used flag
          value.

     'Public function `set_error_recovery_flag''

                            `int set_error_recovery_flag (int flag)'


          sets up internal flag whose nonzero value means making error
          recovery if syntax error occurred.  Otherwise, syntax error
          results in finishing parsing (although function 'syntax_error'
          in function 'parse' will be called once).  The default value
          is 1.  The function returns the previously used flag value.

     'Public function `set_recovery_match''

                            `int set_recovery_match (int n_toks)'


          sets up recovery parameter which means how much subsequent
          tokens should be successfully shifted to finish error
          recovery.  The default value is 3.  The function returns the
          previously used flag value.

     'Public function `parse''

                            `int parse (int (*read_token) (void **attr),
                                        void (*syntax_error)
                                                (int err_tok_num, void *err_tok_attr,
                                                 int start_ignored_tok_num,
                                                 void *start_ignored_tok_attr,
                                                 int start_recovered_tok_num,
                                                 void *start_recovered_tok_attr),
                                        void *(*parse_alloc) (int nmemb),
                                        void (*parse_free) (void *mem),
                                        struct earley_tree_node **root,
                                        int *ambiguous_p)'


          is major parser function.  It parses input according the
          grammar.  The function returns the error code (which can be
          also returned by 'error_code').  If the code is zero, the
          function will also return root of the parse tree through
          parameter 'root'.  The tree representing the translation.
          Value passed through 'root' will be 'NULL' only if syntax
          error was occurred and error recovery was switched off.  The
          function sets up flag passed by parameter 'ambiguous_p' if we
          found that the grammar is ambiguous (it works even we asked
          only one parse tree without alternatives).

          Function 'read_token' provides input tokens.  It returns code
          the next input token and its attribute.  If the function
          returns negative value we've read all tokens.

          Function 'syntax_error' called when synatctic error has been
          found.  It may print an error message about syntax error which
          occurred on token with number 'err_tok_num' and attribute
          'err_tok_attr'.  The following four parameters describes made
          error recovery which ignored tokens starting with token given
          by 3rd and 4th parameters.  The first token which was not
          ignored is described by the last parameters.  If the number of
          ignored tokens is zero, the all parameters describes the same
          token.  If the error recovery is switched off (see comments
          for 'set_error_recovery_flag'), the third and the fifth
          parameters will be negative and the forth and the sixth
          parameters will be 'NULL'.

          Function 'parse_alloc' is used by Earley parser to allocate
          memory for parse tree representation (translation).  After
          calling the class destructor we free all memory allocated for
          the parser.  At this point it is convenient to free all memory
          but parse tree.  Therefore we require the following function.
          So the caller will be responsible to allocate and free memory
          for parse tree representation (translation).  But the caller
          should not free the memory until destructor is called for the
          parser.  The function may be called even during reading the
          grammar not only during the parsing.  only during the parsing.
          Function 'parse_free' is used by the parser to free memory
          allocated by 'parse_alloc'.  If it is 'NULL', the memory is
          not freed.
