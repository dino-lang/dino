   TITLE:       Allocation package include file

   DESCRIPTION:
       This is header file contains macros and the ANSI C prototype
       definitions for the allocation package  (allocation with fixing
       error) and class for the allocation package (allocation with
       fixing error).

   SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:
         The function which processes allocation error should never
       return control back because after calling the function the
       function `abort' is always called in the debug regime.
         Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g. by option `-D' in C/C++ compiler
       command line) before the package macros usage disables to
       fix some internal errors and errors of usage of the package.
