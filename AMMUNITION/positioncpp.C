   TITLE:       Package for work with positions of files

   DESCRIPTION:
         The package implements abstract data which reflects current
       file positions.  The abstract data is represented by classes
       (see file `position.h').
         The strategy of the package usage can be follows.  Function
       `initiate_positions' is called by the first.  After that
       function `create_file_position' is called when a file is opened
       for compilation as source or included file.  Members
       `line_number' and `column_number' of variable
       `current' are modified correspondingly during given
       file compilation.  The value of `current' can be
       stored into internal representation for usage for output
       diagnostics on following passes.  Function
       `finish_file_position' is called when a processed file is
       closed.  Function `finish_positions' may be called after all
       processing a source file.

   SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:
         Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g. by option `-D' in C++ compiler
       command line) during the file compilation disables to fix
       some internal errors and errors of usage of the package.
